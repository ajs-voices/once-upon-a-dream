# Ball Drop

**Zane**

Angel's hand was warm in mine.  He trailed along after me, winding our way through the crowd stopping at the bar to get two drinks.  Champagne was being passed around the club for the ball drop.  Traditions we'd started our first year.  It cost a lot but it was worth it.  It brought in the customers for the holiday event.  And we made more money than we lost.  It was well worth it in the long run, and it created many a regular.

I headed to the stage where the band was playing, they were finishing their last set before I'd take the mic.  Drew was shy.  His public speaking skills made him vomit so he didn't do it. And Finn was gruff and not very charismatic.  Great man.  But he didn't present the fun filled vibe we went for with Zion.  So that left me to count down the ball drop and be host.  Angel tried to linger by the bar but I dragged him after me.  I may not be able to kiss him at the stroke of midnight, but I was damned well going to do it soon as I stepped down.

The crowd was turning towards the stage even those on the dance floor knew it was almost time, there was always this buzz that went around midnight.  Like the whole world stopped for the New Year.  And it did just not all at the same time.  I probably had a good two minutes of talking time.  It's a good thing I already knew what to say.  I stepped up as the music died down and Angel stayed where he was.  I tugged his hand inviting him along, he was always center stage on the dancefloor.  He only hesitated a little.  I had to drop his hand to take the mic as the lead singer handed it to me.  "One of our gracious hosts."  He said as the mic left his hand.

I heard whispereing behind me and saw Angel shaking his head.  "I don't play."  He grinned but I didn't hear what he whipsered back.  I took the guitar from the stand.  It was mine and had been waiting for me very innocuously on stage for this moment.  It had been a whole year since I'd played in front of a crowd.  Sometimes I wondered why I let Drew talk me into it at all.

Those who knew me cheered the others waited patiently.  I played a simple rift and the crowd cheered.  I didn't have to shout but it felt like my voice would go raw.  "Welcome to Zion."  I waited as the crowd cheered.  "It's been a hell of a year.  Drew ..."  I pointed towards my partner who was maning the bar.  "and his wife had their first child, a bouncing baby boy.  He's been adjusting and you've all been great understanding with the new personel.  We love you guys."  The crowd cheered. It was always good to prase our customers.  It's why they keep coming back.  "Finn and I nothings changed.  Another year older, but I doubt any wiser."

There was laughter in the crowd and Finn shouted, "I don't think we could get any dumber!"

The crowd laughed more.  "The New Year comes with big new surprises.  We have signed with Nate here for the next year.  They'll be playing with us every Friday night."  The band played a small set as the crowd cheered again.  "And now it's almost here.  Let's count it down."

I turned to see Angel smiling at watching me.  I offered him my hand and he took it as the clock clicked 10, the crowed shouted and I spoke into the mic, "10."  Angel was next to me and my arm slide around his waist.  "9... 8... 7..."  Angel was quiet but I felt his breath on my neck.  "6... 5... 4..."  We all raised our cups for the final three seconds.  "3... 2... 1... Happy New Year!"  The crowd went wild and I pressed a kiss to my pretty boy's lips.  It wasn't hungry or filled with our prior lust.  I'd have said it was sappy and cute.  I walked towards the side of the stage and handed the mic back to Nate.

He shouted an incomprehensible word into the mic and the crowd burst into cheers again.  Everything in the club that had been at a standstill for those few minutes was now buzzing again.  The bar was over worked and I sighed.  "I don't think I can leave."

Angel shurgged.  "It's alright.  I'm going to go find a quiet place."

I laughed.  "In a club?"  I pulled him along past the bar and towards the security booth.  I punched the code in the door opened and I took his hand and dragged him past the security screens into Finn's office.  "Quiet and you can have some people to talk to if you want.  Maybe you'll find new hiding spots from the cameras too."

Angel laughed.  "I don't need places to hide unless you want to join me in them?"

I winked and patted Finn on the shoulder.  "This is Finn.  I know you two know of each other, Finn this is Angel.  Angel my best friend Finn.  And my business partner."

Finn offered Angel his hand.  "And the only one of us he hasn't slept with."

Angel raised his eyebrow and smirked.  "You don't like men.  Or I'm sure you would be on the list."

Finn chuckled "Nah, Zane and I aren't ever like that."

He nodded, "Uh huh.  I'm sure there was never any sexual tension."

I shook my head.  "I'm going to go help Drew at the bar.  If you need me Finn has the walkie."

Angel smiled and pressed a kiss to my lips, he lingered a few seconds staring into my eyes before he stepped back.  "I'll be fine.  Might take a nap."  He winked and it went straight to my cock.  He was implying a lot in those four words.

"I'm going now."  I said but I didn't move.

Finn grabbed my arm and pushed me towards the door.  "He'll be fine.  I won't bite.  I promise."

I heard Angel say, "I might like that," as the door closed behind me.  Shit!  I just stuck my... I sighed, Angel in the same room with Finn for I don't know how long.  Maybe I should have just let Angel go upstairs to my office where it was boring.  No telling what Finn was going to say.  But I didn't really have time to think about it.  I had a bar to help untangle.  We were all earning our pay tonight.
