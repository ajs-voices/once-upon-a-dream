# Zion Christmas

I had a few hours to kill before I was due at Zion for our annual Christmas bash.  It was the only time we closed the club that wasn't a major holiday.  We weren't going to be open for three full days in a row this year.  We did open on New Years Eve - what club would close on the biggest party night.  I shouldn't think about Angel, but he's not far from my mind as I got ready.  Was he playing a game?  What was he going to do about his father?  What was I doing to do?  I mean fuck, my Spanish was a bit rusty but I caught most of it.  I wasn't sure how Mr. Vega was able to hide so much of his life.  Pretty boy wasn't exactly subtle and neither was Chef Marco.  How did my dad not know?  Maybe he did.  Seems like something he'd keep quiet if there was a potential conflict of interest with clients.

I needed to change my train of thought.  Work was a better option than what I was going to do about a non-existant relationship with a man I barely knew.  But I still couldn't keep my mind from him.  I put on more Zion appropriate clothing, tight black jeans and a matching black t-shirt that said Zion.  I could work from home, but there was no point in staying, I could finish up my paperwork at Zion just as easily and Drew and Finn would be there making final touches.  Mandy would be there too, hopefully they found a babysitter.  This was their first bash with their new baby.  They probably both needed the evening alone away from the kid.

Thinking about Drew and Mandy brought the conversation I'd had with Angel earlier to mind.  The tattoos and the stories I didn't tell him.  Tris and Very had screwed me big time, but when it repeated itself with Drew and Mandy I swore off dating became like the machine the tattoo depicted.  I wasn't in love with Drew or Mandy when we all got together for a few rounds.  But they fell in love.  They never asked for me to step out.  It wasn't the same situation, I just stopped as soon as I saw them together and in love I just bowed out.  I didn't have any hard feelings.  Drew and I hung out.  Mandy and I still hung out.  We just weren't having sex anymore.  I was happy for them.

You'd think the first time I would have learned not to introduce people into my sex life at the same time.  I was a weak man.  I wanted both worlds, but life didn't work that way.

I let it all go, all thoughts of Angel, of past relationships and took a deep breath.  Tomorrow was Christmas Eve - tonight was a party.  And one I would feel comfortable at.  I knew these people, they were closer than family.  I could bring a date - I should bring one.  But I wasn't about to bring Jennifer and Angel was working.

No matter what I did he never left my thoughts.  All the more reason to go to Zion and forget about everything that happened today.

Zion wasn't far from my building.  It was a quick walk even in the cold.  I could hop a train, but between the wait time and the train itself I'd still get their faster by walking.  Tonight we hired a DJ to work instead of a live band.  We could treat our employees with a good band, but this way we could play whatever we wanted.  That is the pleasure of digital music these days.  The bar was open except for the most expensive top shelf labels.  Those you paid for.  Our high end clients bought them, we only made our employees pay cost, we didn't need to go broke.  But most of our employees were fine with whatever was on tap and the fruity sexy drinks using cheap alcohol.  The better to get drunk with.  Tonight we relaxed - let our hair down and have a good time together.

The building itself was nondescript, we had a marquee outside that told you who was playing that night and the next nights.  It wasn't Time Square worthy but it was catchy despite the buildings plain exterior.  The marquee represented Zion as a whole - the black letterin and the purple neon lights.  In the wrong vein it could look like a huge bruise, but our marketing team did an excellent job of that - well worth the money we spend on it.

There was no line, it was still early even if the marquee didn't read "Closed Sunday Night for Zion's Annual Christmas Bash - Invite Only"

The one and only night we only let in people on the list - invite family and close friends only is the rule.  I never had anyone on my arm.  Never anyone on the list.  My close friends were all here and my family wasn't interested in the scene.  My cousin's might but they had their own things and I'd prefer to keep this my thing.

Dino was at the door waiting as usual.  He sat inside the door waiting for someone to knock.  We didn't have a sliding window like you see in the movies.  Usually the door was propped open and Dino or Mike would do their thing.  I'd seen Angel on any number of occassion kissing his way in.  I didn't think Dino or Mike were particularly into men, but Angel was right about one thing - he was pretty, but not in the way a woman was traditionally pretty.  He was tall and thin, but solid.  His eyes lashes were long as were his fingers, arms and legs.  If he didn't maintain his build he'd probably be one of those gangly men, too thin for their own good.  If he dressed like he did last night for the gala he fit pretty to a T.  Even in jeans and a t-shirt he was pretty.

"What's got you in a sour mood?" Dino asked as he let me in the door.

I shrugged.  "Nothing.  Just a long night."  A long night and a good morning.  It had been a while since I'd had one of them.  And my thoughts were straying to a certain pretty boy and I had to get my mind elsewhere.

I took the stairs to the offices and found Finn idling in the security room.  He was dressed the same as I was except his shirt was tighter and so were his pants.  Finn was lounging in one of the reclining office chairs while he looked at the camera feeds.  No one was on the screens.  "What you looking at?"  I asked.

Finn jumped.  I couldn't help but smirk.  "Not doing anything I wouldn't were you?"

Finn returned my smirk with one of his own.  I sat down and let out a long huff of air.  Finn asked, "Tired?"

I shook my head. "Long story."

"Care to tell it?"

"Not really.  I'm here to try to think about other things."

"That bad?"

"No.  Not bad at all.  That's part of the problem."  I sighed.  "Saw pretty boy last night at the gala.  He was tending bar.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised to find him working.  More surprised I hadn't run into him like that before.  We use Fiore for everything.  I had a perfectly good date, who I took home because she was drunk.  And I went back for him."

Finn raised his eyebrow and smirked but he didn't say anything.  "Fine."  I groaned.  "I brought him home."  I scrubbed my fingers through my hair and collapsed back into my chair.  "Fuck, Finn.  I brought him home.  He cooked for me and I walked him home and met his parents."

I rushed forward and leaned in to be descrete but it came out more of a shout than a whisper.  "Get this, one of his father's is Daniel Vega.  And he wasn't pleased to see Angel with me."  I smirked. "I'm sure the hickey's all over his neck didn't help matters."  I collapsed against the chair again.  "All joking aside, I'm fucked."

"As in Hudson, Kennedy and Vega?  That Vega?"  Finn asked.  "I thought he was with some hot Spanish chick."

I shrugged.  "Who the fuck knows?  He was sitting in a robe on the couch reading the paper and Chef Marco waltzes into Angel's bedroom to introduce himself and scold Angel in a round about sort of way."

"He lives at home?"  Finn smirked.

"Like I said I'm fucked!"

Finn stood up and pulled me up by the elbow and dragged me back downstairs.  "I'd say it calls for a night of drunken daubachery but I know that's not your style.  But let's have that drink anyway."

"I have nothing against drunken daubachery as long as it's fully conscenting." I smirked.

For this occassion we didn't hire bartenders.  All our bartenders would prefer to work the night and chat like they do.  The only difference being the showing off in the beginning is grand standing, by the end it's just them trying to see how well they can do it drunk.  Half filled bottles end up busted and we are out more money than the party.  But it's one night.  I learned to let it go after the first one.  I didn't need the anxiety that came with it.  I just watched the money go down the drain - quite literally.  But most of our employees understood that it was still our money and that it wasn't to be wasted.  Accidents happen.

Drew was behind the bar and his beautiful blond wife sat in front at the bar.  They were heavy into a conversation.  I wrapped my arm around Mandy and pressed a kiss to her cheek.  "How is the my second favorite mother?"

"Your second favorite?"  She grinned at me with her bright blue eyes shining back.

"Mine is my first favorite, sorry, Mands."

Finn sat down next to Mandy.  "Zane needs a double."

Drew looked at me and frowned.  "I'm fine.  Long day."

Finn chuckled.  "He took his pretty boy home last night."

I leaned forward and glared around Mandy.  "Let's let everyone know."

"There isn't anyone here."  Finn laughed.  "Just your friends.  Dino's outside and no one else is here yet."

Mandy put her hand in my and squeezed.  "Maybe it's about time you got back out there."

I gave her a sideways look and she laughed.  "I know.  I know.  It never goes right and Drew and I didn't help."  She chuckled, "Just don't introduce a third into your life."

Finn laughed.  "Too late for that.  Daddy dearest wants him with some girl from work.  And he's fretting over pretty boy."

I sighed.  "He has a name."

"I know it.  You know it.  But unless you want it to be personal, I'll keep calling him your pretty boy."

"He's not mine."

Mandy sighed.  "I bet he could be."

"You know who we are talking about right?"

She nodded.  "I do.  Tall, built but kinda skinny still, dyes the tips of his hair and has a great pair of eyes."

"Whoah, you been checking him out?"  Drew asked his wife.

Mandy laughed.  "It's been a while, honey but yeah, it's hard not to check him out.  He all but screams look at me."

I sighed.  "So you all know he's a player.  He's never with the same girl in here twice.  You've never seen him with another guy."

"I have seen him with another guy.  They haven't been in here together as a couple in a good while.  But I've seen him.  Same guy - the only guy."  Finn said.

"Slightly shorter than him, darker complextion like he has a tan all the time, dark hair and eyes?" I asked.

"Sounds about right."  Finn agreed.

"Yeah I've seen him too."  I stood up with my drink in hand.  "You guys aren't helping at all."

Mandy caught my arm.  "Zane, honey, don't over think it.  If you like him, go with it.  People change.  But if you are doing it because your dad doesn't approve then I'd let him go.  Don't fuck up your relationship with your dad because he wants you to get married and have kids.  Talk to them both.  You might find something surprising as a result."

Several others walked in and Mandy let my arm go.  It was time to focus on my people.  The family I was curating here.  No more pretty boy and no more confusion.  Just family.
