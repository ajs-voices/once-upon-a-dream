# Moving

**Zane**

Fuck I missed him.  He fell asleep in my arms.  I watched him for a long time before I started to get chilly and decided one of us had to get up to fetch the blankets and pillows.  He groaned when I moved his arm and clutched at me tighter.  I whispered against his ear closest to me, "Just getting the blankets."

He groaned again and removed his arm from my waist and I could slither out from underneath him.  I tossed a pillow  and it landed on his head but he quickly snatched and put it under his head while clutching it in his arms.  I could see the goosebumps forming on his skin in the dim light of the City shining through the windows.  I covered him up and glanced at the time on my alarm clock and sighed.  I was awake now.  Pretty boy was sleeping.  I watched the rise and fall of his chest while I walked out into the living room to fetch our phones.  Last thing we needed was a freak out about where it was when he woke up.

I also picked up the clothes on the floor and tossed them in the hamper turning out all the lights on my way back into the bedroom.  I sat on the end of the bed and called Finn, his shift was just ending at Zion. As the phone rang I curled up at Angel's back his arms still around the pillow he moved to press his back against my side.  But I knew he was still sleeping, just gravitating towards me in his sleep.  If that didn't say this was right, I didn't know what was.

Finn picked up, "Hey, Zane, how's meet the parents go?"

"Good."  I said softly.

"Why we whispereing?"

"He's asleep next to me."

Finn chuckled, "Why didn't you just leave the room?"

"You don't want to hear my answer."

"Another question, why's he there, I thought...."  He didn't finish the question, we all knew what he thought.

"He moved in.  Which is why I'm calling actually.  I want to move Saturday's here."  I said quietly.

"Alright.  You'll have to call Drew in the morning."  Finn said with a yawn.

"And afterwards, can you big burly men help us get his things in storage.  I'd rather not go play basketball with Ant and his brother.  Suggest it tomorrow, make it seem like it's your idea."

Finn laughed.  "You lying to him?"

"No. I'll fess up but it's easier if you offer.  I seem less like the jealous boyfriend."

"You are the jealous boyfriend."

Angel rolled over when I groaned, draping his arm over my stomach and resting his head on my shoulder.  He mumbled, "Tell Finn hi. And you have to go."

I chuckled.  "Hey Finn, Angel says hi, and now I have to go.  We'll see you here same time as usual."

We said our good-byes and I snuggled down with Angel pressed against me, "How much of that did you hear."

"All of it."

"Does it bother you."

"No."  He pulled himself closer to me and pressed a kiss, "I like that you are jealous.  Means you care."  He drifted, then caught himself, "Just a reminder, I only want you."

I wrapped my arm around him and held him close.  "I know, Angel.  Sleep now."

He didn't need much encouragement to drift back into sleep and surprisingly I went fast myself.

I woke up to an empty bed when there was a crash in the kitchen, and hushed swearing.  I rolled over and looked at the clock and sighed.  There was plenty of time to sleep, but I had to grab a shower, and call Drew and the thought of missing the entertainment of Angel playing with his food was enough to pull me out of bed.  I pulled on a pair of sweats and a t-shirt and padded out to the kitchen.  Angel was was sucking on his finger and when he looked up he gave me a sheepish wave with his other hand and mumbled, "Sorry." around his finger.

"What did you do?"

Angel waved his finger in the air, "Smashed my finger in a cupboard."

I nodded.  "I know which one.  I've done it several times."

"It's a hazard."  He grinned.

I held out my hand and he let me see the injured finger.  It was read, but pinching it in the cupboard was easy it slammed shut on it's own if you weren't careful, and it was heavy so it hurt like an son of a bitch. I brought it to my lips and kissed it sofly.  The grin on Angel's face was worth the silly gesture.

"How long you been up?" I asked as Angel pulled his hand from mine and washed his hands probably for the thirtith time since he started cooking.  He hated wearing gloves so he washed all the time.

"About an hour, I didn't want to get out of bed, but I needed time before they all got here."  He said as he moved around the kitchen grabbing a mug from the cupboard to pouring cream and sugar into my coffee he poured from a french press that sat on my stove.  He also had a pot brewing in the machine, but it was just sitting there.

I sat at the island in the living room and drank my coffee and watched as my pretty boy in a pair of my shorts and my t-shirt moved around my kitchen like it was his.  And I couldn't help but grin, because he'd taken my suggestion to heart.  And I was starting to notice that all his boxes were unpacked that we'd carried from his apartment and things were rearranged.  "I see you made yourself at home?"

He turned around and grinned at me as he stirred a pot on the stove before turning around to look at me, "You hungry?"

"I can wait."

He shook his head and opened the microwave and pushed a small stack of pancakes at me.  He opened the freeze and pulled out the icecream and handed me the scoop.  "You'll have to do that, I can't let the mole sauce sit much longer or it'll burn."

I scooped ice-cream on top of my pancakes and got up to put it back in the freezer so it didn't melt.  I could capture my lover against the stove but then my icecreamwould melt and everything would be soggy.  I sat down and started eating.  Angel was busy moving around the kitchen working on whatever he was doing.  He'd check his notebook, and his ingredients and make a note.  Then go back to working on it.  I wondered if it was like watching me write music.  I enjoyed watching him work.  It probably helped that he danced around the kitchen.

I interrupted the silence between us with a question.  "Does your dad dance around the kitchen?"

Angel chuckled.  "No.  Babbo since opera.  He'll belt out songs in Italian while he's working.  The kitchen staff all know the words to his favorite ones and will sing with him sometimes."

"Eccentricitiy runs in your family doesn't it?"

He grinned at me.  "It's a learned trait."

By the time I finished my breakfast, washed my own dishes and grabbed a shower, Drew had shown up with the kids and Mandy.  I had forgotten to call him.  I wondered how they knew and when I was about to ask Angel grinned at me, "I called them."

I gave him a big kiss and Drew groaned but Mandy awwwed.

The first thing Angel did was kiss them both on the cheek before it took the little one and took him into the kitchen with him.  I watched him cradling the baby in his arm while he spoke to him as he finished his things.  Mandy stood next to me and whispered, "He's good with Liam.  And Liam likes listening to him.  I have no idea what he's saying to him though, I can never overhear him."

Drew laughed.  "He's telling Liam all about what he's doing.  I asked him.  Angel said he tells Liam what's plauging him on a receipe and Liam listens and gurgles up at him and Angel figures it out usually while he's explaining the problem.  I asked him why he didn't just tell someone who could talk back."

Angel interrupted Drew with a chuckle, "I don't tell you because you talk back, make suggestions that may or may not be right and usually it's something I was just missing, so I by telling Liam, I figure out what I'm missing."

Mandy asked, "So what prompted this move?"

"Zane asked.  I said yes."  Angel said as he turned around and went back to work.  But Drew and Mandy were already pulling small plates from the pile to get food Angel had set in front of us.

Finn arrived and as he walked in he blurted out, "Hey, Angel, Drew and I can help move your things fater this if you want."

Angel chuckled and nodded.  "Alright.  I didn't really want to go play basketball anyway."

And Angel didn't even mention that he already knew the plan.  We went through the guinea pig experiments and we were all stuffed.  "I have to go to work in an hour."  He looked at me with a frown.

Finn shurgged.  "Give Zane the key we'll get everything taken care of.  Where you storing your furinture?"

Angel texted me the address.  "Zane has the address and the unit number."  He handed me two keys and we would do it when we could move again.  I was slightly disappointed Angel and I didn't get much alone time before he went to work but before he left I gave him my key, I'd get another one from the front desk.  It was where I kept my spares anyway.  I think everyone in the building did.  Just made sense.
