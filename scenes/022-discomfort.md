# Discomfort

Zane left me cold but I stayed lying on his bed naked with the lights on.  The plus side was I could watch him walk away.  I saw a tattoo on his hip and admired the lines and the way he moved.

He came back and he stopped in the doorway and looked at me.  "You still want this?" He asked.  "You going to walk out on me when this is all said and done?"

He was doubting this.  And now I was.  "I promised you breakfast."

"So if you hadn't?"

"I don't know."  I crooked my finger at him.  "Please come back here." I knew I was begging, but I was cold and hard and I still wanted him in the worst way possible.  "Please." I echod.

Zane sighed and pushed off the door frame.  He crawled on the bed next to me and laid on his side facing me.  His fingers trailing along my chest.  He was lost in thought.  I didn't want him thinking about anything other than what we were doing in that moment.  I pushed him back against the bed and took the tube from his hand and tossed it to the side on the bed.  "I'm not going anywhere, Zane."  I straddle his body and looked down at him.  Some of that light from earlier returned.  I couldn't help biting my bottom lip looking down on his blue eyes.  I wanted this so bad.

He ran his fingers through my hair and and pulled me down to kiss him.  I snaked a hand between our bodies and grabed our cocks and stroked them together.  The feel of his hard shaft against mine made me moan into his mouth.

All prior drama was forgotten as we got back into the grove.  Our bodies sliding against each other.  I searched the bed for the foil packet and lube, but Zane's fingers found them first and he pushed the packet into my hands as we kissed long and deep.  Our bodies were hard against each other.  His fingers gripped my hips and he pulled me against him.  I pulled away and slid down his legs so I could view his cock and slide the condom on.  He was beautiful and it wasn't sexual fancy.  His body was perfect.  He was perfect.

My fingers slid over his cock rolling condomn down, my eyes on his as I stroked him through the rubber applying lube.  He watched me and I stared back at him.  "Yes?"  I asked him as I pressed him against my hole.  My body was tight and waiting.  I could feel him inside me already.  I might come too soon I wanted him so bad.

He didn't answer me just pressed up and pulled down on my hips and I gasped at the intrusion.  My head fell back and Zane sat up.  I wrapped my legs around his waist and his mouth found my neck.  There was barely any movement but it was all that I needed.  He'd hit that perfect spot and I was seeing stars as he slid inside me and sucked on my neck.

My fingers dug into his back as the warmth built in my stomach and thighs.  I was going to come and I fought the feeling back.  I needed him to come.  Zane whispered against my skin, "Come for me pretty boy."  He pressed harder inside of me and my control fled and I was gushing against our stomaches as he released inside of me.  He thrust a few more times riding the edge of his orgasm and pushing me father over the edge.

We collapsed into a heap on our sides and I held on to him I didn't want the moment to end.  Removing the used condom and tossing it in the garbage by the bed was the last thing I remembed before we both fell asleep entwined under his sheets.

I woke a few hours later and the light was still on and Zane was on his side facing away from me.  I laid on my back and stared at the ceiling.  This was the time I'd usually walk out the door.  I felt uncomfortable lying in his bed, but I didn't have that desire.  Other than a large lump of blankets next to me and the inky black hair sticking out the top I'd be alone in bed.  In his bed.

I rolled out of bed and went to the bathroom, turning off the light as I left.  I stood in front of the mirror and wondered what I was doing.  Why I had agreed to stay?  Why did I want to?  It was so far beyond my normal that I was having a panic attack.  I felt it creep up.  That feeling of dread that crept up when I least expected it.  I wasn't in my bed.  I wasn't home asleep dreaming about having sex with the man with beautiful blue eyes.  His body was even more perfect underneath me than in my dreams.

I washed the eyeliner off the best I could.  The warm water helped calm me.  I could use a good shower, but this wasn't my house.  I took a deep breath and went back into Zane's room.  I tripped over our clothes and jostled the bed.

Zane asked softly, "You alright?"

"I'm great."  though I knew my voice didn't sound alright.  It never did in the middle of a panic attack.

Zane sat up, "What's wrong?"

I didn't walk around the bed like I had intended instead crawled up from the foot of the bed and back under the covers where it was warm.  I hadn't realized how cold I'd gotten naked in the cool air of Zane's apartment.

"Nothing."

"It doesn't sound like nothing.  Do you need to leave?"

"It's just new.  This feeling."

Zane laughed.  "What feeling?"

"The feeling that makes me stay."

"You want to stay?"  Zane asked and before I could say yes was pressing a kiss to my lips.  Our lips lingered and our hands found skin but that was it.  He whisperd into my ear, "Sleep then."

It wasn't long before I was back asleep and dreaming of my blue eyed boy who was holding me close at that very moment.
