**Zane**

The food was excellent.  Desert was good, but the coffee was better.  I was still a little shocked to find out pretty boy was our chef.  Drew and Finn didn't bring it up again, at least they knew when not to meddle or get involved.

Our dinner turned into a proper meeting over the chocolate cake and coffee.  Several more cups of coffee were drank and we were the last ones out.  Even the hostest had left but no one bothered to kick us out.  There was a guy at the bar washing glasses.  I guess he was going to close up.

"I think we're done here."  Drew said as he glanced at his watch.  "Mandy's gonna kill me.  I'm so late."

We all stood up and headed for the door.  I noticed that the bartender was pretty boy.  He was watching me from down cast eyes through those long lashes and I couldn't help the reaction.  Drew shoulder checked me.  "Whatever." I mumbled.

I looked at him polishing that glass like he wasn't watching us leave.  He set it down and took his phone out of his pocket.  I saw him turn and start texting and I frowned as I walked out into the foyer and grabbed my coat from the rail where they sat waiting for us to collect them.

My phone beeped and I glanced at the number, there was no name. I had no idea who it was.  I almost didn't read it except I saw the snippet underneath.  "Next time let me cook for you for real."   I opened the message after I pulled my coat on.

Unknown Number: _Next time let me cook for you for real.  You'll be my only distraction.  :) ~Angel_

I looked back but the bar was empty.  So much for that.  Drew grabbed my elbow, "Come on lover boy, let's go!  I'll drop you off."

I shook my head.  "I can walk."

"It's fucking cold out here."  Finn shouted as he opened the door.  "Don't freeze your balls off, your pretty boy might not like you then."  He smirked and headed for his car.  "See you later.  I need to get back to Zion."

Drew waved and looked at me, "You sure? It's cold."

"I'm good, D.  Don't keep Mandy waiting."  I turned the opposite direction of Drew.  WWhat I really meant to say was 'I'll the train'.  I headed towards Grand Street Station to catch the D.  The platform had several people waiting and I looked at my phone again and the message that still sat there.

I sent a reply.  I gave him my number.  He finally responded to it.  I hadn't been waiting for it.  I was disappointed that there was no response but then I saw him in the locker room.  He stood in front of me, looked me in the eye with that smile and said 'I'll see you around'.  I asked myself what I'd have done in his place.  I wouldn't have taken his card.  Well I would have but then I would trash it with everyone else's.  I knew he was a player.  He was a regular at Zion, I knew his game.  Shit!

I still sent him a reply.

_Your other distractions couldn't have been as hot as me._

I stuff my phone back in my pocket as the train rattled up to a stop.  People piled out and those of us waiting piled on.  We were shivering getting on and they were just now starting to feel the cool night air and would hit the cold block of ice that hit when they got top side.  I was glad I had a good 20 minute ride home to warm up at least a little.

My phone beeped again and I hestitated.  I should just wait till later.  I leaned back in the chair and heard it go off again.  I sighed.  There were two messages waiting from that unknown number.  I tapped it open.

Unknown Number: _Noone is as hot as you._

Unknown Number: _Behind you and to the right._

I looked behind me and to the right.  Siting in the rear of the car there he was.  He wasn't looking at me.  He had a pair of earbuds in underneath a wool cap he had pulled almost over his eyes.  His head was resting against the back wall and he looked exhausted.  I turned back around and sent him a reply

_You tired?_

Unknown Number: _Never for you. But yeah  long day.  And another one tomorrow._

_Covering again for your dad?_

Unknown Number: _Depends how he's feeling tomorrow on top of two finals_

_Finals?  You're just a boy._

Unknown Number: _Spent a year and a half cooking my way around Europe.  I'll tell you about it sometime._

_You think I'm going to say yes then?_

Unknown Number: _You haven't said no._

He had me there.  I hadn't said no.  I hadn't said yes either.  I hadn't actually said anything to his proposal of him cooking for me - alone.  I stared at the message for a long time.  I really didn't know what to do.

Unknown Number:  _I'm out at the next stop.  Don't want you to think I'm following you.  I'll see you around :)_

The train pulled to a stop and I turned to watch as he got up.  He smiled at me his eyes still mostly hidden by the wool hat.  He bit his bottom lip and waved as he jumped out the door ahead of the people getting on.  I wondered how far he had to walk from here.  I stood up and jumped off the train myself and then sent a quick text.

I looked around but I didn't see his tall frame in the people leaving.  Damn.  Missed him.
