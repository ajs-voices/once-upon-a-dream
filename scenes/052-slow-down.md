# Slow Down

**Angel**

I had come to see Zane.  But he wasn't here so I settled into be Cal's wingman.  I had an Irish Red and then we hit the dance floor.  He had quickly eyed a group of girls from school.  He and Jake tried by themselves to get the girls to dance, but they refused them.  Cal begged for my help so I went out with them.  I got them all on the dance floor with ease.  A quick smile, a touch on her cheek and shoulder.  Sweet talk.  All normal, but I didn't dance with them like I would have normally.  I kept my distance.  I kept my thoughts on innocent things.  I knew Zane's friends were here.  I'd see Drew behind the bar when I'd gotten my free shot.  And I knew Finn was manning the cameras.

So when I went to get another beer while Cal and Jake were off with the girls I was suprrised to see him standing behind the pink drink in my hand.  I remembered my comment from New Years about the sex on the beach and so did Zane.  I smiled at him.  But I didn't say anything.  I didn't stare. Hell I didn't even really watch him, I was so caught up in my own thoughts.  Deciding if I should leave, or if I should stay.  Or what I'd say if I stayed.  Before long last call was being hailed and I remained in my spot.  No one asked me to leave.

My heart was beating fast and I was nervous as hell, but Zane hadn't told me to fuck off so I was hopeful.  I missed him.  Just seeing his blue eyes made my evening.  Talking to him would be great.  But I knew he was going to help clean up so I offered my assistance to Drew, but it was Finn who put me to work.

I knew there were eyes on me as I cleaned in my dad's 20's era suit.  He'd worn it to a costume party and didn't want to return it.  My dad looked like a ganster in it.  A real one from the 20s.  As much as my father hated it I was pretty sure they'd played cops and robbers with it a time or two.  Jail was a fun time for Babbo.  Or at least it sounded like it that night when I snuck in late.  That's how so many of my nights went.  Kinky parents getting it on while I was out but forgetting I came home too.  I never said anything but I knew they humped like bunny rabbits.

I chuckled to myself as I thought I'd probably be the same at their age.  I jumped when Zane asked, "What's so funny?"

I didn't look up as I kept washing the table I was working on.  "I was just thinking about my parents and their sex life."

"I thought you didn't like that topic."

"I don't."  I said as I swipped the drying rag across the top of the table to catch the last bit of drying before putting the chairs on top.  Zane lifted the one on his side and flipped it over and I followed suit.  "I was just thinking that I think this suit has seen a lot."

Zane groaned.  "Now I'm seeing it.  Thank you."  He shoved my shoulder.  "We are almost done here.  You want to grab breakfast with me?"

I shook my head.  "I think breakfast is bad for us."  I sighed.  "Pie maybe."

Zane had frowned at my refusal but he nodded at pie. "So I'm not getting breakfast again?"  He said playfully as we headed for exit.  He already had his coat on.

I didn't stop to grab a coat and he stopped, "You didn't bring a coat?"

I shrugged.  "I have to stop at my parents house before I go home.  My coat's there, it's not far. so i didn't bother."

"You found a place?" He asked as we headed towards the diner around the corner that made excellent pumplin pie year round.

"Same day I last saw you."  I said flatly.

"That was quick."

"Luck.  I went to visit an old friend and there was a vacancy across the street.  I can't afford it for long.  We'll not how I want to anyway."

"Meaning?"

I sighed.  "Meaning I have to touch my trust to pay the bills.  It's the reason I was living with my parents.  I wanted to be able to afford my place without my parents help."

"So why didn't you just go back home after...."  Zane let it linger.

I opened the door and Zane went into the diner and found us a booth.  We sat opposite each other and didn't say anything until the waitress came by, "What can I get you boys?"

"Pumpkin pie and coffee black."  I said.

Zane laughed, "You didn't have a good experience in season you want to try again?"

"Their pumpkin pie is awesome here."  I said.

"Apple pie with vanilla icecream and coffee please."  Zane said.

Our waitress left and we sat in silence again.  Zane repeated his last question, "Why didn't you go home?"

I sighed and looked down at the table.  I could feel my teeth clenching my bottom lip hard and let it go.  "You asked me not to."

"Did you go see ... Ant?"  Zane's voice had started to spew venom at the question but he paused and stopped and took a deep breath before he had continued.

I shook my head.  "I haven't seen him since before Christmas when he came to Fiore."

I pulled the suit jacket off and rolled up the sleeves as the waitress stopped at our table again with our coffee and pie.  She didn't stay longer than it took to place our plates and cups.

Zane asked, "Why not?" before he took a sip of his coffee.

"Same reason."

"I saw Jennifer again not too long ago."  He said after a bit of apple pie.  I took a bite of mine and nodded my head.  I didn't want to sound jealous so I didn't say anything.  If he wanted to tell me more he would.  "We had a little talk.  She made me realize why Ant bothers me so much."

I didn't ask why.  He'd tell me or he wouldn't.  I hate half my pie before Zane touched my hand and made me look at him.  "I'm not ever going to be like him.  I don't want someone to follow orders because it makes them feel good.  I want a partner.  Equal shares.  You need that domination, I saw how much you enjoyed it on New Year's eve."

I looked down.  "You don't know anything about me, Zane."

"Tell you didn't enjoy it.  That it didn't make you happy."

I wanted to leave.  This wasn't going to work.  "Of course I enjoyed it.  Of course it made me happy.  but not for the reasons you think."

"Then why?"

"Because we were exploring our limits together."  I pulled my wallet from my pocket and dropped money on the table.  I looked up at him definatly.  "I was happy to do as you asked me to because you asked me to. I like to be told what to do, but if I've not shown you that I can take charge enough already, then my submission to you over the past few times is going mean nothing to you.  I'm sorry if we can't get past it.  I don't want a fucking dom, Zane.  I don't want a top.  I don't want a master and I sure as hell don't want to be with someone who thinks that's all I am." I slid out of my seat and stood over the table and bent down to talk in Zane's ear.  "I wanted you.  I loved you.  It happened so fucking fast I couldn't breathe.  I can't stop thinking about you.  I wanted to see you so bad tonight and then Mike said you weren't here.  I almost went home.  I think I should have."

I stood up and turned to leave with my suit jacket hung over my shoulder.  I didn't want to stop long enough to put it on.  Zane caught my free hand and pulled me towards him as he stood up.  We were staring eye to eye just a few inches apart.  "You used the past tense.  Is it not still true?"

I looked at him confused.  "You said I wanted you.  I loved you.  Is it not true?"  he clarified.

"I still want you and I still love you."  I pulled my arm from his grip and walked away.

I made it outside before Zane caught up to me and grabbed my arm.  "You aren't walking away this time."  He smirked, "That's supposed to be my thing."  He took my jacket from my hand and drapped it over my shoulders.  "Let's slow this train down, okay? Let me walk you home."
