# Dinner for Three

**Angel**

I needed to go out and destress but the cold weather brought with it illness.  And my family wasn't immune to it.  After my final I found a text from Babbo that said he was sick couldn't make it in.  My dad had asked me to cover for him.  He knew I had a final the next morning.   So there I was standing behind the stove doiong the one thing I loved above everything else - cooking.

I had a final.  But it was in Italian I and I wasn't worried about it.  I'd been speaking Italian since I first learn to talk.  It was really odd sometimes walking into my house.  Dad would yell at me in Spanish, Babbo would sooth Dad in Italian and I'd respond in English and we all understood everything we said.  But to a stranger it was just random.  It was how it had always been.

I loved being back here with Babbo, but usually I got stuck doing the dirty work.  Babbo said I had to understand every facete of the business from cleaning plates all the way up to head chef.  And I did so without complaint most days.  I got paid just like any other person except I wasn't given just one job.  I was paid for the job I did.  Today mean I was doing it for free since Babboo owned the place.  His salary only happened if Fiore was in the black.

We don't hit the red very often but it has happened.

Nadia brought in a chef's special order.  That was unusual - not for Babbo but for me it was.  I didn't usually get those requests.  Usually they canceled that from the menu while anyone but Babbo was here.  She handed me the ticket.  "You okay with that?  Uncle Marco said it was okay."

"He said that?"  I asked as I started the next mean on tap.

"Yeah.  Said for the regulars you could.  They'd be more forgiving."

"If I screwed up?"

Nadia giggled.  "No, cousin.  He said they'd forgive him for hiding you.  These three look like they'd be foregiving."

"What three?"  I asked.

She crooked her finger and pushed the double doors open and pointed in the direction of three men talking over a bottle of wine.  I grinned as I saw blue eyes sitting there and smiled.  "All right then."  I said.

I called out a quick order for an appetizer I thought they'd like.  I'd seen them here before.  Always here on Monday nights.  I'd never had the chance to wait on them, but I'd bussed their table once or twice.  Never actually got to see blue eyes though.  I pulled the business card from my back pockect and ran my fingers over the lettering as I decided what to make for them.  I could do any thing I wanted and that was the hard part - just deciding.
