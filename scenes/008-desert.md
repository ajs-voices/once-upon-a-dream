# Desert

**Angel**

Nadia came back into the kitchen and smiled.  "They bet a lemon tart."

I grinned.  "Should I let them win, or give them something else?"

Nadia smiled.  "I'm partial to the chocolate cake Laura makes.  The big man said he wanted to meet the new chef."

I nodded.  "I'll take out desert then."  I was excited and nervous.  I knew my food was good but I didn't exactly do this for a living - not yet anyway.  And I wasn't used to going out to the chef.  Center of attention I could do but I didn't exactly like praise.  I liked my attention to be false.  "Let me know when they are done."

I kept busy with the other dinners I had on tap.  I finished meals for three tables before Nadia came back and informed me they asked for coffee with their desert.  "That decides it then I guess.  I got it all.  Andre can you finish this one for me.  I'll be right back."

"Sure thing boss."

I grinned.  I wasn't the boss and they knew it but I was my dad's replacement.  One day I'd have my own restaurant.  One day...

I made fresh coffee and got three slices of Laura's chocolate cake and decorated the plate myself.  I wasn't pastry but I wanted to do this one myself.  I heard Nadia come up behind me and laugh, "Don't tell me you are crushing on the big guy?"

I smiled.  "I can't tell you that."

"The blond one has a ring on his finger."  Nadia laughed.  "The other one isn't your normal type."

I smiled.  "You don't know my type, Nad.  Never did."  I picked up the tray and hefted it over my shoulder with the coffee and the cake and walked out of the kitchen wearing the white of the chef and my apon still on.  I really hadn't thought about what Babbo would do.  I'd have to pay attention next time.

I got a few looks walking out of the kitchen dressed like I was.  I doubted Babbo actually brought the food out himself.  I set the tray on the fold out table a busboy laid out for me.  And set a plate in each of the men and then a cup before I actually looked up at them.  "I hope you enjoy it."

"You bake it yourself?"  The married one asked.

I laughed.  "No.  I don't bake.  Not really a follow the directions kinda guy."

Blue eyes looked up behind him and I smiled at him.  "You cooked all this?" he asked.

I nodded.  "I did.  Well I didn't make the cake.  Our lovely Miss Laura baked it."

"You work here long?"  The big one said.

"I've worked here most of my life."

"You've been cooking most of your life."  The blonde asked.

"Duckling, no.  I've washed every dish here a few hundred times.  Waited the tables soon as my dad thought I could handle it.  Tend bar every so often.  Only thing I haven't done is hostest."

Blondie laughed.  "You are pretty enough though, I don't know why not."

I flashed him a smile.  "I apreciate that.  I don't fit the image of Fiore's beauty."  I put my hand on blue eye's shoulder and squeezed.  "Is there anything else I can get you?"

"We are good."  He looked up at me with a smile.  "Thank you for taking the time to come out here to see us shmucks."

I smiled.  "Anytime."  I squeezed again. "I hope you enjoy the rest of your evening.  Take as much time as you like."  I walked away from the table wanting to look back and see what they id, but I didn't.
