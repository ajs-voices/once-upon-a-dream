When Angel said he could come right then and there I thought it was just a boast.  One of those things you say when you are exaggerating your poweress.  I thought I'd call his bluff.  When he didn't hesitate I watched with amusement, but he went slack, his body relaxed against the end cap.  His face and everything about him said he'd given up something.  His voice came out heavy with desire and he begged for me to touch him.  I obliged him.  Fuck that look in his eyes I'd do anything he asked right then.  My body reacted to his.  I hadn't expected this.  I kissed him and he parted his lips.  I slipped my tongue in his mouth and in moments he was cliFinning and I drank down his moans as his body went weak and I pressed mine against him.

I hadn't expected any of it.  Hadn't dreamed he'd do that.  But all I knew right now I wanted to get him naked and fuck him.  Breakfast be damned.   My stomach growled as we parted making a liar of my thoughts.  But Angel just smirked with his eyes still closed.  I took his hand and tugged.  He easily followed and  I picked up the basket.  "What else do you need?"

"Strawberries and raspberries, unless you don't like either.  Bacon and eggs and milk."  His eyes were still closed he was trusting me to not walk him into something.  I did it on purpose and he he opened his eyes after running into a moveable freezer in the middle of the aisle.  "Hmmm..."  His smile was lazy and he looked at peace.  I'm not sure that's how I would be after coming in the middle of the grocery store.

We grabbed the rest of the items on his makeshift list and I picked up a bar of dark chocolate and dropped it on the counter to pay for it.  He looked at me with a smirk but said nothing as he pulled out his wallet.  I was quicker and handed the clerk the tips he'd been given me. I grinned at him.  "It's your money.  I was planning on giving it back."

Angel chuckled.  He hadn't said much since the orgasm.  But I let it go for now.  Waited until we were outside and walking down the early morning streets of New York City.  "You do that often?"  I asked to break the ice.

He laughed.  "It's been a long time since someone asked me to do that with no foreplay."

"You've done that before?"

"Not in a grocery store."

"But grocery stores are so sexy, so where then?"  I asked curiously. I knew a little about that sort of life.

"Usually in a controlled space.  There's a few clubs around town I used to frequent."

"Used to?  Meaning you don't frequent them anymore?"  He wasn't into it anymore?  It's not like its a kink that changes.

"No time.  Growing up.  I haven't been back since shortly after I gradated highschool.  Went to Europe didn't play for a while and with classes I just don't have time.  And before you ask, it's not a need.  I found other ways to get that feeling."

We walked into my building carrying our groceries.  We walked past my doorman and to the elevator.  "I'm going to be honest.  It's not my scene."

Angel grinned at me.  "I know.  And it's not my scene.  It was just an outlet."  He wrapped his arms around my waist and pressed me up against the wall.  "There's this guy I keep seeing around.  I hear he's got an exhibitionsist streak, and mixes a fine sex on the beach.  Sadly I think he's taken."

"Is he now?"  The door dinged and we stepped out onto my floor.  I was smirking and Angel was grinning at me with a twinkle in his eyes.

He nodded.  "Yeah by some dumb college kid who thinks he might live up to his father's reputation as a five-star chef."

"I hear he's already there."

Angel ducked his head and bit his bottom lip.  He didn't blush, but I knew that those offhand comments embarassed him.  Nothing else seemed to though.  I unlocked the door and pushed it open.  "By the way, what you did back there, was fucking hot."  His body reacted to the praise.  And I think I understood a little bit more why he liked those places.  "One more question before I take your clothes off."

Angel's eyebrow lifted as he took the bags from my hands and started setting things out.  He put the icecream in the fridge.  "Only one?"

I nodded.  "Just one.  Do you miss that life?"

Angel shook his head and licked his lips as he brushed his fingers through his hair that fell over his eyes.  The wet weather having made his hair fall flat.  "No.  I can always find someone to do the parts I like.  You have managed rather well for a guy who says he's not into that scene."

I smirked as I walked towards him.  "I am curious to know if you could do it again for me."

"Come for you on command?"

"Yes."  I said as I stood in front of Angel.  "Can you do it again, pretty boy?"

Angel shuddered at my words and his body relaxed like before.  He nodded.  "That's a second question. I can try, it's a lot harder after the first time."

"I guess I have a lot more questions.   Do you always listen so well?"

He smiled at me.  "I pride myself on listening very well.  I dislike punishment, prefer praise and so I obey without question to the best of my ability."

I smirked.  "Good to know.  And is that a scene thing?"

He shook his head.  "No.  Natural inclination.  I was hit as a kid by foster parents.  I learned to behave so I didn't get hurt."

"Jesus Christ.  If that doesn't kill the mood."

Angel frowned.  "My life didn't start out pretty.  My fathers are great, they love me.  I love them.  But I have baggages."

"We all have baggage, Angel."  I pressed him against the counter.  "If we go into the bedroom, I don't think we'll leave."

Angel chuckled.  "Is that so wrong?"

My stomach rumbled.  "Yeah.  I'm starving."  I grabbed Angel by his shirt and pulled him close and pressed a hungry kiss to his lips. "Mmmmmm....."
