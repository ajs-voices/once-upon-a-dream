# The Almost Confession

**Zane**

I was still a little dazed by what went down in the shower.  If this was more than a one night thing we had a lot to talk about.  And it was a talk I was looking forward to having, but still he was a player of the worst kind.  I recalled a conversation I had with Finn one night when I covered a shift at Zion.  Watching the cameras was a boring job.  But it was always entertaining.  I found a quiet corner that seemed to have occassional visitors.  It was still on the dancefloor but other than other dancers there was only one camera that could see it and it wasn't the greatest angle.  But couples were in and out of the corner constantly.

I'd seen Angel many times before over the past few years at the club.  And I'd seen him in the corner with girls of every flavor.  Never the same one twice.  Finn saw what I was watching and laughed.  His voice boomed in the small security booth when he spoke to Rick sitting next to me.  "Zane found Necker's Nook, and our favorite play boy."

I had to ask, "Necker's Nook?  And your favorite playboy?"

Rick came over and stood behind me, his large finger poked at the screen.  "That's Angel alright.  If he didn't tip well I don't think he'd still be coming around."

"He's bribing us?"  I asked.  Only slightly annoyed.

Finn sat down and pulled his chair closer to watch the show.  "He's not bribing us, tips the bar well. Tips the doorman before he comes in even if he's not getting in early.  He tips the coat girls.  He tips his server.  He tips the DJ.  Flirts with everyone.  And he tips well.  It's not a bribe.  Maybe getting in is, but the rest isn't.  He drops a lot of cash on our doorstep.  And with that everyone turns away while he's playing his game.  Not that you can ever catch him."

"Aren't we catching him right now?"

Rick laughed.  "No, he's just putting on a show there.  He's already banged that one in the restroom."

"How do you know there are no cameras?"

"I've been watching him a while I know his tactics."

I sighed at the memory.  And he just fucked me.  Shit!

I was pulling on my boots when he walked out of the bathroom in my sweats and t-shirt looking much more put together than before.  He was raking his fingers through the blonde tips distracted by something.  "Something wrong?"

He looked at me with a grin.  "Hair's wet."

"You have a thing with wet hair?"

He sighed.  "Catch a cold?  It freezes, and I didn't bring my hat since I was supposed to be presentable last night."

"You can borrow one."  I smirked.  "Not like you aren't borrowing already."

He walked across the room and sighed.  I looked at what he was staring at and realized sweat pants and dress shoes, how bad does that look.  "You can borrow a pair of shoes too."  I sighed as I walked into the closet and pulled out a pair of sneakers.  "Though I'll need them back I like them."

He frowned, "You sure?  You can come up and I can give your things back?"

I chuckled.  "We'll see.  It gives you an excuse to see me again."

His face lit up in a smile and he bit his bottom lip and I watched as the relazation it him and he let it go with a sheepish grin.  "Habit."  He said to explain his lapse.  He sat down on the bed and tugged my shoes on.  It was probably good thing we were close to the same size.  Angel's voice was quiet. "You want to me to see you again?"

I looked at him - really looked at him.  I saw the bold and brazen man who made friends at Zion and could probably get away with murder there and right now he was not very confident.  The shy smile, he wouldn't meet my eyes with that question, so quiet when I knew he wasn't any of those things.  "Why wouldn't I?" I ask.

He shrugged and the man I'd seen before was back he was standing a little straighter as he walked to his tux and started folding it.  I scoffed.  "No.  Stop."

He rolled his eyes.  "The dry cleaning will get the wrinkles out."  He  protested.

"No."  I said as I walked into my closet and grabbed a suit cover "Hanging in a garbage bag is better than what you are doing to that."

"You are as bad as my father."

"Rented, or owned you treat a fine Armani tux with care."

He smirked. "What?"

He shook his head and pulled his lips in like he was keeping some big secret.  "What? " I asked again.  What had I said?

I shouldered him as I grabbed the tux from his hands.  "Tell me."

He giggled - fucking giggled and I couldn't help but smile at the cute behavior.

"Did you read the label?"

"What?"  I asked.  I wasn't sure where he was going with this.  Or why he thought it was funny.

"So you knew what kind of tux I was wearing?"

I rolled my eyes.  "So I'm gay because I can tell what type of suit you wore?"

"You said it, not me."  He was in front of me in a blink and his hands were on my hips, biting his bottom lip.  "But no, but you are probably the gayest man I've ever been with."

I pushed him away from.  "Fuck you."  I didn't like that at all.

He was still grinning like I missed a joke.  He put his hand behind my neck like he had in the shower.  His grip was firm.  I could have walked away if I wanted to but I was pretty sure I didn't want to.  "What I mean to say is that the men who I typically let fuck me say they aren't into men.  That it's a one time thing.  That I'm too pretty not to fuck."  He spat out pretty like it was a swear word.  "They always want more.  You are at least man enough to be open about what you like."

I pressed a kiss to his lips and he ducked his head breaking the kiss.  I tucked two fingers under his chin and lifted his eyes to mine.  "You are a pretty boy."  **My** pretty boy, I wanted to say.  And from the look in his eyes when I said those five little words he wanted me to say them to him.  "But if I ever find out someone is fucking you just because you are pretty I'm going to kick their ass."

He laughed.  "So if they are fucking me for any other reason it's okay?"

I wanted to say no it wasn't okay, that he was mine.  But...

I pressed a tender kiss to his lips and he let out a small moan at the touch.  I didn't want to take him home, but he had work.  Tomorrow was Christmas Eve, and I was going to be busy doing the family thing.  I wouldn't be seeing my pretty boy until New Years Eve more than likely.  I shoved the wrapped tux into his arms and sai "Come on, let's get you home before you are late for work."
