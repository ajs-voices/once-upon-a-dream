# Secrets

**Zane**

Angel moving in was a big deal.  But there were other things that needed to be dealt with too.  While Angel was in the shower I snagged his phone and took Ant's number.  He wanted to play the game of who's better than who, I wasn't about to give him the advantage by playing a game without my own friends.  And Angel wasn't really a player of sports, I'd already told Finn and Drew what I was planning and they were all game.  It had been a while since the three of us played a pick up game - probably since college.

My friends weren't the ideal basketball players - I didn't expect Ant's friends to be much different.  But you never knew.  I had called Ant and set up a three on three at the park.  I could have scheduled a court at the gym but I also found out on the phone that day that Ant was a personal trainer there and that's how Angel got the job teaching yoga.  How the fuck did I miss that completely?  But I wasn't actually checking the personal trainer schedule either so I guess it could just be a timing thing.  But I had never seen him there, not even with Angel.

We all met up at the park.  It was late for Finn, but early for me and Drew, might have been too early for me, but it was the only time Finn could make it.  Angel was in class since it was a Monday.  Ant had been hesitant to play without Angel watching.  I wasn't, Angel wouldn't have watched anyway, he'd have had his notebook and stetching out whatever it was he was doing in that thing.  He left it lying around I could have peaked, but it somehow felt wrong.  And if he wanted me to see it he'd say so. I'd be pretty ticked if he'd looked in the notebook I kept all my half finished songs in - at least without asking first.

I was surprised to see Ant there alone when the three of us walked up.  He gave me a smile and offered me his hand, "Hey, Zane."  I'd almost have liked the guy if he hadn't tried to force Angel into something.  I introuced Finn and Drew and Ant shook each of their hands.  "Unlike your friends my friends are all peices of shits who stay up all night partying and are now too drunk to play. But Dad and Henry agreed to join."

Not exactly what I was expecting.  That was when I saw two others walking up towards us and one was a much older, more defined version of Ant - that had to be his father, and the other was the tattoo artist from acros the street.  It made me wonder why Ant never came over if his brother worked across the street.  The brother didn't look like either of them, he must favor his mother.  Ant introduced his father as Tony and his brother as Henry.  Henery took my hand and grinned, "You must be Angel's mysterious guitar guy."

"He's talked about me?"  with you, I almost added.  I don't know why I found it odd he was talking about me with his friends but I did.

Henry laughed.  "He said nothing at all, but I know Angel well enough to know that he just doesn't get random tattoos that mean nothing, and the A kinda gave it away it was about someone."

Tony sighed.  "Angel's fear of needles keeps him from talking to anyone while it goes down.  Unlike other customers who won't shut the fuck up."  He bounced the ball, "Shall we?"

We went toe to toe.  Ant avoided me most of the time on the court when he had the ball.  But Finn and Drew took it upon themselves to show him just how much love they had for him.  They didn't know why I didn't like Angel's best friend.  I hadn't told them that he'd forced Angel.  Or that they were fuck buddies.  Though I was pretty sure they knew that.  But one thing was for certain no mater how hard Drew tried, Ant never even blinked in his direction flirt as he might.  I might have mentioned that Ant didn't like men.  And Drew was always up for the challenge.

It'd been a fun night trying to convince Finn he was missing out on something.  All we ended up doing was giving Finn something to harass us about years later.  Though he had let us kiss him.  He liked to lord that one over us.  He never did tell us who was the better kisser.

The game went pretty much as you expected a game with strangers to go.  There was shoving, and language.  But all in all it was a good game, and we all left sweaty and hot.  What I hadn't expected when I got home to grab a shower before hitting the office was to find my pretty boy dancing around the kitchen making lunch.  He looked at me when I walked in the door and there was lust and a tad bit of jealousy written all over his face.  He came over to me holding out a spoon for me to taste.  "Homework," he said.

I tasted the sauce and nodded, "It's boring."

Angel grinned.  "I know.  So not my thing, but they said it was about the technique not so much the flavor - so whatever.  I have to get back to class soon.  Why are you all hot an sweaty?"  He managed to say the latter without pouting too much.  But he only accomplished that by walking back into the kitchn.

"I was playing basketball with Finn and Drew.  I decided to take Ant up on the offer."

The house smelled like goo food, but walking into the kitchen was even better.  My... no, our apartment always smelled great when Angel was cooking.  I was so going to get fat!

He looked at me over the pot he was stirring.  "And you didn't invite me?"  He sounded a little hurt but there was mostly humor in it.

"You didn't want to be my cheerleader and I know how much you detest organized sports."

He sighed.  "I still would have watched."

"You would not have.  You'd sit there in your notebook like you always do when I drag you someplace you don't want to be."  I said as I wrapped my arms around his waist and kissed his neck eliciting a soft moan and his ass pressing against my groin.  "What's in that thing anyway?  Something more important that me." I joked.

He chuckled.  "Nothing's more important than you." He said but never turned around.  "You know where it is, I'm not hiding it from you."

It was more a challenge than anything so I snatched it from the counter where it rested open while he cooked.  It wasn't ever far from his side.  I started at the beginning and saw his to do list... Or more rather his travel list.  Angel had a wide array of places he wanted to go.  Which pretty much amounted to traveling the world.  In some countries he even had little notes that said he wanted to visit some small village here and do learn how to make words I didn't even know how to say in some cases.

On susequent pages, Angel had receipes jotted down and some were starred others were x-ed out completely.  He had our reviews of the meals jotted down.  Other pages contained drawings of booths, and cooking stations, and god knows what else he used in the cooking arena.

There were other notes from classes he'd taken on his 'mission' statement.  On his brand.  He had names written out, some were even sketched out in logos.  He drew pretty well for a chef.  I doubted it was part of his career, more something he'd learned from school or something.  There were uniform skteches and floor plans.  He was building a restaurant.  His own brand.  I was impressed.  "You should type this all up.  Make it look good."

Angel blushed actually blushed which was a rare occasion to see that rose color creep up his neck and turn his ears red.  "It's on my laptop."

I asked, "Do you mind?"

He shook his head.  "I don't keep things from you." I kinda almost felt a stab of pain in that, like I was hiding something from him.  Did I feel a little guilty for trying to see what kinda of friend Ant really was.  But I had been wrong about Ant.  While he did avoid me, and Finn and Drew boxed him out several times, I learned from Henry and Tony that Angel was like a little brother.  I guess they didn't know about the sex, and I wasn't about to tell them otherwise, that wasn't my secret to share.  But Ant never once tried to show me he was more man than I was.  He even apologized again as we were leaving.

I found the document and sent it to my printer in the office.  The images were there, like in the book, but he had place holders for them.  Angel was packing his things up as I came out.  "You mind if I make notes to help you out?"

He shrugged.  "Business is your thing."  He smiled and I could tell he was feeling uncomfortable showing me half finished work.  But that was just a testiment to his trust.  He was a perfectionist.  And I was coming to learn that more and more and it was difficult to not try to change it.   He was too hard on himself, and I hated seeing the pain it caused him.

Angel came over to me and slung his backpack over his shoulder.  "I'll see you later."  He pressed a deep kiss to my lips that left me breathless and wanting...  Fuck he knew what just to do to make it very hard to watch him walk out the door.  I'd have to remember to pay him back for that.

Thankfully I had a shower waiting for me.

I spent about a week thinking about Angel's business plans.  He knew nothing about actual business.  But the detail that went into the restaurant side of things was extensive.  I hadn't realized just how much there was, or how much my pretty boy had picked up from his father. It was easy to make notes, actually I had just modified Zion's plan and pulled it into Angel's document.  He had a great concept.  He had the skill to do the actual work, but no business chops.  I filled in the holes and then took it to my dad to make sure my thoughts were not going to be legally an issue.  I'd done the same with my own company, let my Dad do the legal thing.  I was overstepping my bounds, this was Angel's project, but I was exicted for him and myself actually.  I couldn't help it.

I left the papers with my dad and we went on with life as usual.  Living with Angel was different.  Our schedules didn't mash up at all.  Most days we only saw each other for a few hours in the morning.  And only because I broke up my sleep to eat breakfast - which was well worth the displeasure of waking up before I had a good 8 hours of sleep.  But the time we spent together was better now than just seeing each other on scheduled times.  It all felt much more schduled now and it was a little mind blowing how easy Angel just flowed through life with a schedule.

I knew his OCPD was mild compared to others, but living with him I saw it unfold in a new light.  Those first few weeks were tough.  Everything was in a different place, and he had a hard time adjusting to it.  Mandy hadn't organized his things the right way.  And he'd spent three days organizing every closet in the house.  Obessive was not even the word to begin to cover how it went.  But being the foot in mouth guy I am I asked him, "Why do you care if it's organized?"

He looked up from his spot in front of the closet while he sorted through old pill bottles.  "Right now this is calming," he said.  I'd seen the way his shoulders had slumped more and more.  He wasn't sleeping well.  I guess I hadn't made the connection until he said it, "Right now everything is overwhelming.  I need to control something."  He grinned at me, "And I have no special occassion to get a new tattoo for.  So I do this."

I sat down on the floor against the wall and watched him.  We spent the afternoon talking about his issues.  He did most of the talking, I listened.  I felt overwhelmed but he assured me it wouldn't be like this forever.  "Change is hard."  He said.  He was right.  I was adjusting too.  Just didn't have the same things to overcome.

And before long Angel was his normal self.  And those two weeks were nothing in comparison to the rest of our life...

And that was the scary part.  My  mother was pestering me to meet Angel.  Said she wanted to meet the boy who was going to end her grandbaby dream.  She was being melodramatic and I knew she didn't mean it.  But until she stopped with the drama I wasn't bringing Angel home.  When I had Sunday brunch with my family, Angel went home to his.  I picked up him and then the rest of the day was ours.  It was our day.

Saturdays and Wednesdays were still the same.  So  when Drew needed help there was no real question about whether or not I'd do it, but I when I got back from the delivery I hadn't expected to see my father eating food and Angel reading a print out.  Angel looked over the paper with a wide smile.  "Why didn't you show me this?"

I shrugged.  "I have my own perfectionism."  I stuck my tongue out at him.  "I wanted my dad to make sure there wasn't some reason why it wouldn't work - on the legal front."

I looked at my dad and waited for his answer since he was obviously here to tell me.

My father never looked up from his plate as he finished eating whatever was on tap for the day.  When the plate was clean and he was using a peice of bread to clean the sauce from the plate he looked up at me.  "Normally, I'd advise against co-signing with a current lover for the fear that you'll break up.  It's not you Zane, or even Angel, just a general advisement.  And while I still don't suggest it, there are no reasons why you can't use the storage facility Zion purchased next door.  Renovate it and make the restaurant.  I'd suggest you keep both businesses separate, have the restaurant pay Zion a leasing fee, that way if one goes under you aren't at least taking them both down."

I nodded, "Of course.  And we haven't even discussed anything remotely close to that."  I looked at Angel who was still reading the paper my dad had given him.

"Anything else, Dad?"

"Your mother wants to have dinner - with you both.  If you don't arrange it soon, she will just stop by."  He said.

"As if that has ever stopped either one of you."  I groaned out.

My father laughed as he stood up and walked around the bar to interrupt Angel's reading.  "Angel, it was a pleasure to finally met you.  I would very much like to meet your fathers."

Up until that moment Angel was fine, then all blood rushed away from his face as he paled.  "I don't think Daniel is ready for that just yet.  He's only just starting to come to terms with me."

Angel wasn't completely returned to normal, his color was still off.  The eyeliner made him look worse than it really was.  He sounded perfection normal as he invited my parents to lunch, "Why don't you and Mrs. Kennedy join us here next Saturday for lunch.  I'm sure we can talk my parents into coming.  And talk Finn and Drew into another night.  Or Zane can take them left overs for a week."

"I already do that."  I sighed.  "Fine.  You are going to make us all fat you know that right?"

He grinned at me but he didn't say anything, he usually made a comment that does he look like his food makes you fat?  Which usually prompted a lot of flirting and hands wandering afterwards.  I saw the twinkle in his eye and knew exactly what he was thinking.

My father accepted the invitation and I had my own panic attack.  My mother was going to meet my boyfriend... fuck!
