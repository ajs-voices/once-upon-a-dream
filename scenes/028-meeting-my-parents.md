# Meeting My Parents

**Angel**

We gathered my things and we were at the door when Zane grabbed my elbow.  I didn't get a chance to turn around before he was stuffing a knit cap over my hair.  It rather rudely flattened my hair and the blond tips were sticking out from underneath.  I pulled it off and was thankful that my hair was still damp no static.  I pushed my hair back and pulled it back over my head so I didn't look ragged.  "Thanks."

Zane was still smirking at me.  "I thought it looked cute the other way."

"I looked five."

"You could never look five with that scruff."

I chuckled, "That's kinda the point."

I carried he tux in a bag over my shoulder and we walked to my building.  Zane glanced down the road we'd pass to go to the gym but he said nothing. Once block north of that we turned and didn't even go to another block once we had crossed the street.

I asked, "You want to come up?  I can give you back your shoes at the very least.  You seemed partial to them."

"Is that a good idea?  You live with your parents."

I shrugged. "It'll be a new experience for us all.  Me bringing home a guy."

Zane laughed.  "Not only are you bringing home a guy.  You are coming home in his clothes, wearing nothing underneath and sporting a few big hickeys on your neck."

"I like my accessories."  I grinned at him.

"I noticed you hadn't covered them up though you could have."

"I'm not shy."

We were outside my building and Hal opened the door.  "Good Morning, Angel."

"Morning Hal.  How's Steph?"  He stepped aside and smiled.

"She's great.  Lina says she missed yoga on Monday."

I laughed.  "Yeah she'd have had to get there early.  I'll get you when I come back down."

Hal shok his head.  "It's alright, son.  But you are cutting it close."

"I know.  I won't be long.  This is my friend Zane.  He might be stopping by again."  I took Zane's hand and we walked through the door.

"Do you tip everyone?"

"It's how I was raised?  Dad says if someone is doing you a service you show your appreciation."  Zane started for the elevator and I stopped, "Can we take the stairs?  It's only five floors."

Zane smiled.  "Sure, No problem."

We headed up the stairs.  We made the first floor before Zane said anything.  "You are still holding my hand."

I looked down and our joined hands and grinned.  "I am. "  I looked up to his eyes.  "Do you want me to stop?"

Zane squeezed my hand and pulled me close.  "I think not."

I pulled my keys out of my coat pocket.  "This is us."  We stepped out of stairwell.  "It's not as nice as you's but it's home."  I unlocked the door and let Zane into the hall.  "Come on in."  I hung my coat up and kicked off my shoes out of habit.  "I'm home.  You want your shoes?  I have a few more minutes I can kill, if you'd like a tour."

"I want to see your highschool bedroom." Zane smirked.  "isn't that what usually happens in those movies?"

"Come on.  Let me take your coat though."  Zane pulled it off and handed it to me.

He asked, "Do you want me to take my shoes off?"

"Dad would prefer it.  But he won't get mad at you."

Zane kicked off his shoes and stuck then by the rest of them.  "I don't want to upset your folks."

We walked down the hall past the living room.  My Dad was sitting on the couch in his robe reading the New York Times.  "Hey Dad."

He looked up from his paper and his frown was immediate.  "Hijo mío, ¿qué está haciendo aquí?"

"¿No puedo tener amigos?"  He's never carred before about my friends.  Ant came by all the time.

"Sólo tienes un amigo que traes y no es él."

"Really?  I hadn't noticed, Dad."

"Angel, no puedes traerlo aquí. No puedes volver a verlo. Eso arruinará todo."

"¿Ruina qué? ¿Su vida? ¿Tu carrera? ¿Que hay de mí?" I took Zane's hand and pulled him down the hall to my room.  "Don't mind my father, he's grumpy in the morning without his coffee."

I pushed open my bedroom door.  "Sorry about that."

Zane chuckled.  "What was that about?"

"My Dad wanted to know why you were here."

"Am I not supposed to be?"

"You are Stephen Kennedy's son.  Your father doesn't know my father is gay nor that he has a spouse and a son.  He's worried you'll tell your dad about him."

Zane nodded.  "Ah.  Like I have conversations with my dad about his partners. I avoid the topic as much as possible."

I open my closet door and pulled out a pair of pants and a button up shirt.  I grinned at him, "Mind if I keep the t-shirt a while?"

Zane raised an eyebrow and smirked.  "I kinda like the idea of you wearing my clothes."

There was a knock on my door.  "Carino?"

"I'm here Babbo.   It's unlocked and safe."

Zane pressed me up against the closet door and pressed a chaste kiss to my lips just as my dad walked in.

Babbo chuckled.  "Mr. Kennedy, a pleasure."

Zane pulled me against him.  "It's Zane, chef.  Mr. Kennedy is my father."

My dad stood in the door way watching me curled around a boy.  His eyes were light with amusement.  "Your father is upset.  You need to apologize before you leave."

"I'm not apologizing for bringing a friend here."

He sighed.  "Apologize for walking away, that's all.  I will see you at Fiore?  Cino says you owe him."

I grinned.  "I made Zane breakfast this morning.  I needed things."

He patted my head and ruffled my hair.   He offered Zane his hand.  "A pleasure.  Hopefully I'll see you again."

"If your son brings me around again."

Babbo laughed.  "Oh I think he will."  And with that he left closing the door behind him.

Zane kissed me hard.  "I should go.  Let you deal with your father and get ready for work. "  I licked my lips then moved to my neck and bit and sucked on his favorite spot.  I pulled him against me and groaned.

He let me go and smirked.  "I'll see myself out.   Call me."

I nodded.  "When I get off work it'll be late."

"That's alright."  He pressed a kiss to my lips.  "Be good, pretty boy."  I watched him leave my bedroom.  I stepped out into the hall and watched Zane walk to the end to the front door.  He turned back as he grabbed his shoes and his coat.  "I'll see you round Angel."  He smirked.
