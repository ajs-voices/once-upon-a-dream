# Making a Date

**Zane**

Angel looked at me with sad eyes.  I wanted to take it all away and I knew my big mouth was a lot of the problem.  But we had a lot of things to work through, but the fact that he came to Zion to see me kept me wondering why were we fighting and over this.  Maybe it was all too fast.  "Let's slow this train down, okay? Let me walk you home."

He turned and started walking in the direction of his parents place while he disgracefully put his arms in the jacket without letting it fall from his shoulders where I put it.  It wasn't far and I knew it but when I caught up to him I took his hand and I saw a small smile spread on his lips.  "I'll stay downstairs while you do what you need to."

Angel sighed.  "That's probably for the best."

Inside the lobby I found a chair and waited in it.  There was a trash magazine sitting beside it and I flipped through it while I waited.  10 minutes past, then twenty and I was wondering if he's snuck out on me.  The elevator doors dinged and I turned to see who was coming out and my smile grew and my heart did a little skip.

I asked, "You ready?"

Angel nodded.  "Yeah, sorry it took so long, Babbo was up and interogating me."  Angel had on a big puffy coat now and his wool hat was pulled down over his ears.  His hands were stuffed in his pockets and I tried not to let the disappointment show.

We walked out into the cold and I asked, "What was he interrogating you about?"

"Why I was wearing his suit.  Why I was coming home so late.  And when he found out you were downstairs he let me go with a smile."  Angel looked over at me and his eyes were darker in the shadows I couldn't make out the color.  There was a small smile on his lips, it wasn't faked, I knew that much about him. "When I said you wanted to slow down he told me to tell you and I'm quoting me, 'He doesn't like roses, or jewelry.  Key to his heart is chocolate.'"  Angel was shaking his head.

"That not true?"  I asked.

"It's all true.  I can't beleive I repeated it to you."

"So chocolate huh?"  I smirked.

He was staring straight ahead as we descend down into the bowels of the city to catch a train to his place.  I was excited and sad and a little worried all at the same time.  We were sitting in an nearly empty car next to each other.  Angel's leg pressed up tight against mine.  After I'd sat down, he'd moved closer.  I draped my arm over his shoulder and he leaned into me a little.  I missed him too.  He spoke softly, "You don't need a key to my heart, you already have it."

I squeezed his shoulder.  "Let's slow this down then.  We keep doing this and we keep coming back for more.  Let's try something new."

He looked at me then.  "Like what?"

"Dating maybe."

He looked out the window and watched the lights flip past as we rattled down the track.  "No sex?"

I took a deep breathe and sighed, "No sex.  I pick you up, take you out, bring you home with a good night kiss and then go home myself.  A date where we get all this getting to know you things out of the way.  And then when things are out in the open, maybe we can throw sex back in."

Angel nodded.  "Alright."

We went down several stops before Angel got off the train and headed down a new direction. I got my bearings and started to memorize the way.  I was going to do this often.  Angel spoke softly into the night, "I almost went back that night."

"Why didn't you?  The offer still stands."

He shook his head and my heart sank.  "It's better this way."  He looked at me and gave me a weak smile.  "I need to do this and if I lived with you we'd end up in bed.  We'd be fighting all the time and I don't want to fight, Zane.  I want more."

I put my arm around his.  "I do too."

We walked the rest of the way to his place in silence.  I took in the suroundings and made mental notes.   The building was nice.  Angel opened the door and waved at the night doorman and headed for the elevator and pushed the third floor.  The hall was nice enough looking.  He stopped in front of a door and pulled out his keys.  "Do you want the tour?  It won't take long."  He grinned. "You can take it from the doorway if you want."

I laughed.  "You living in a closet?"

He shrugged.  "A nice closet."

"Sure."  I said.

Angel opened the door and flipped on the light.  It was still dark in the rest of the hall but the floor was real hardwood with dark stain and looked like it had been polished recently.  I stepped inside and followed Angel.  He took of his coat and hung it in a closet and kicked off his shoes before flipping on the light in the kitchen.  For a studio apartment his kitchen was pretty nice.  I had a feeling that was the reason he rented it in the first place.  Off to the side was a queen sized bed neatly made and very little else in the room.  There was a desk with a computer and books piled high.  One of his kitchen counters was covered in books and papers too.

"Sorry it's a mess."  he said and I wondered if this was messy what he'd think of my apartment in it's present state.

"I like it.  Though I think you need something comfortable for guests to sit on."

He grinned at me, "You're the first guest."

"And I should go.  As much as I want to stay."

He walked me to the door but didn't open it.  "So when are we seeing each other next?"

I smirked, "So eager."  I shoved a hand through my hair and sighed.  "Classes started up right?  When's best for you?"

"Tuesday and Thursdays are light days, I'm done by three.  Wednesday I have a night class but a four hour from one to five.  Monday and Friday aren't good days unless is like 8pm."

"Lunch this Wednesday?" I asked.  "I'll pick you up here at 2?"

He grinned when I said pick you up then nodded.  "Sounds good."  Angel opened the door and he stepped aside so I could leave.

He stood there and I couldn't help it, but I needed to kiss him.  I leaned forward and pressed a chaste kiss to his lips and he let off a small moan.  Our lips lingered pressed together savoring the moment.  Soft, sweet, tender.  My heart was flipping out in my chest.  When I pulled away his eyes were still closed and he was gripping the doorknob and the hem of his t-shirt so hard they had gone white.  "Easy pretty boy."  He relaxed a little and opened his eyes with a slight smile tugging at the corners of his very kissable mouth.  "I'll see you on Wednesday."

He nodded.  And I pressed a small kiss to his lips and left quickly otherwise I'd end up in his bedroom and we had both agreed to take it slow.  Angel called out after me, "Zane?"  I turned around and smiled.  "Call me when you get home so I know you made it okay."  I grinned and nodded then turned back around.  My heart was still flipping out in my chest.  I made it to the elevator without turning around again and once inside alone I slumped against the wall.  What the fuck was I doing?  I didn't date.  Yet here I was walking Angel home, kissing him good-night and going home myself.  But I felt lighter than I had in a month and I would hear his voice when I got home and that in and of itself made me smile.  I was so screwed.
