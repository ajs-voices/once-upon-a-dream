# Busy in Vegas

**Angel**

Landing hadn't been anymore pleasant than take off.  Robbie offered to hold my hand.  I was good, I told him so.  I had my little Zane the bear with me.  That's what I started calling it after that.  Shit I was so fucking screwed.  I had Zane in my ears, and I had his scent all around me.  The only thing I didn't have was Zane.  And those beautiful blue eyes and his warm body and... everything else I missed about him.

But Jacob kept me busy.  I worked more than the 120 hours required for the externship.  But then I didn't expect my dad's friend to go easy on me.  Mark had stuck me in a room at the Belagio overlooking the fountain, which meant I had a great view of the strip, and of Paris Las Vegas across the street.  I could almost imagine I was in Paris - almost.  Except for all the lights around Vegas.  It was breath taking the first few nights, after that it grew to be the norm.

The first night I worked Harvest and sous chefed under a master chef.  I was kept so busy that I fell into my bed after wrapping my arms around Zane the bear and I passed out.  I called Zane when I woke up and he was on his way out the door.  It wasn't twenty minutes after we hung up before I was in the kitchen of Olives running a small kitchen staff for the head chef there.  I managed a good lunch before I was shipped off to Lago.

I didn't know where I was going or when or when I'd get to sleep.  Jacob ran me ragged.  I didn't have time to think.  Hell I barely had time to sleep before Jacob had me bustiling off someplace else.  But I managed to call Zane at least once a day.  And managed to talk longer than a few minutes on Tuesday nights.  The weekends were the worst I think I got three hours of sleep each day.  I was drained.

Babbo called twice and checked up on me.  He asked, "Is Jacob treating you right?"

I hadn't seen Jacob more than once the entire time I was there.  We had lunch on my third day to catch up.  I yawned my answer, "Yeah.  I'm good."

Dad asked if I was too busy.  I denied it with heavy sarcasm.

But my down time always filled me with Zane.  I called him.  I listened to his songs.  I hadn't even tried to listen to anything else while I was there.  I had every song memorized. I loved listening to his voice.  I loved knowing he was playing the guitar.  I imagined it was just for me and it was in a way.  He created the playlist for me. Went through the trouble of uploading the music to my phone without my knowing and setting it all up so I'd have his voice around me when I needed it most.

I knew the timing of every song.  I played it all the time.  It was my new timer.  Zane was always on my mind even if I didn't have time to think about him.

I made one friend.  Greg.  He was being flung around the restaurants as well, but he did it on a regular basis.  It was his job.  He lived in Vegas.  I don't know how he did it.  I had one down day and Greg dragged me around knocking things of Zane's list of things I had to do.  Greg was single, he said he needed a wing man, but he never actually tried to hook up with a girl or any guys.  I think he just wanted a friend.  I was more than happy to play that part while I was there.

I played craps - still have no clue how to play it.  Or how I won any money but hey I'd take it.  Greg had tried to explain and I waved it off.  "Nah, too much for my squishy brain.  You just tell me what to do."  And that's what he did.

We saw a cirque.  We saw a comedian and we saw some other show playing.  I didn't know any of it and I think I fell asleep a time or two before Greg was dropping me off at my hotel room.  He came in and he had a drink or two while I crashed on the bed.  He left disappointed.  I wasn't very good company after he got me home.  He excused himself and said he'd see me the next day.  I told Zane and we shared a good time, but I passed out afterwards I hadn't even hung up the phone.  I had a good night text from Zane when I woke up.  He hadn't even mentioned the fact that I fell asleep on him.

Life was too busy.  It flew by.  It was my last weekend in town.  I had two days to finish off and Zane was too busy to come visit.  Not that I had time to care.  I did't want this life.  I didn't want to be a two bit chef who was flung from place to place.  I don't know how Greg did it.  But I couldn't.

Sundays were light days.  The tourist were leaving and only the high rollers and extended guests were around.  Not that it meant that it was slow - just slower.  I had an hour for lunch at 12:30 and I went to my room to crash for thirty minutes.  I wasn't hungry, I ate all day long, the dish washers hated me.  For dinner I'd hit the gym, I went for a run in the mornings before breakfast.  And I grabbed food before bed.  Not exactly healthy but it worked.  And I never knew when I was getting a break.  I was a glorified slave except I was getting paid - and paid well.  My dad saw to that, some externships didn't get paid at all.

I was almost sleep walking when I opened my room door with the key card.  I didn't notice the lights were already on.  I didn't notice the water running in the bathroom when I walked past the closed door.  And I sure as hell hadn't noticed the bag lying on my bed in my need to just crash.  I flopped on to the bed and crashed into a bag that shouldn't be there.  I blinked at the offending peice and then sat up and looked towards the bathroom.  I rubbed my eyes, figuring I was just seeing things from being so tired.

Zane smirked as he walked towards, "That's the greeting I get?"

"Am I seeing things?"  I asked.  I knew better.  But I was tired, I could be dreaming.  I stood up and wrapped my arms around the figment of my imagination and I didn't honestly didn't care if it was, but the warmth against my chest and the smell of Zane wasn't a dream.  I buried my face against his neck and kissed his neck.

He wrapped me tighter against him, "That's better, but..."

I chuckled and pulled out of my hiding spot and pressed a long deep kiss to his lips.  It was probably a bad idea, but the moment our lips touched my 30 minute nap turned into a 30 minute quickie.  Zane's bag was knocked to the floor and the carefully made bed was a disaster as we laid on top of it naked still in each other embrace when my alarm went off.  I was awake now.  I sighed.  "I have to get back.  I don't know when I'll be back."

Zane laughed.  "I know, but I'm here until Friday... so are you."

I grinned.  "You took a vacation?"

He smiled.  "I came to see you.  I'm going to grab a shower, then get some food.  And hit the casino floor.  Text me when you are done for the night."

I nodded.  "I'm sorry I'm so busy."

Zane smiled.  "I know what I'm doing.  Where do you recomend?"

"Everywhere.  I'll be working Olives tonight. At least that's where I'm going now."

Zane nodded.  "Okay.  Sounds good."  He pressed a kiss to my lips and ran his fingers through my hair before tugging my head back so he could suck on my neck.  His tongue caressed the newest tattoo across my chest.  "I think this one is my favorite."

I grinned at him.  "Mine too.  Always and Forever."

He kissed me softly.  "Always and Forever."  He pushed me away from him and rolled off the bed gracefully.  "You need to get back to work."

I did exactly what he said with a new spring in my step.
