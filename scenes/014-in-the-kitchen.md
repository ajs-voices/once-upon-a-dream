# In the Kitchen

**Angel**

Seeing Zane in Fiore's with a girl reminded me I wasn't meant to date.  I wasn't meant to go after a guy or a girl for anything more than a good fuck.  I'd leave it as that.

I didn't want to make things uncomfortable so I switched jobs with Keith.  He was washing dishes but had been trained to do bussing too so he took my job busing tables while I did the dishes.  I hated the job.  It chiped my nails but Babbo said the polish had to come off on Saturday anyway so it didn't matter I was going to be a normal boy come Saturday night.  I wondered if that meant I had to dye the blond back.  I sighed.  I hated doing that it always stained and made the colors after murky and gross.  I'd have to go to a professional salon and get them to fix it.  Which cost money I didn't have.  I should make my father pay for it for his fucking image.

It was really the only time I got pissy about Dad's proper image.  When it affected what I wore.

Kitchen duty was fine.  I got to listen to Babbo shout orders and I even got to help out at times when things got backed up.  Dishes be damned.

When their chef's special came up for desert.  "Babbo?"

"SÃ¬, mio figlio?"

"Mind if I do desert for that table?"

He looked at me.  "Why?" His accent was much more prevelant at work than at home.

"Blue eyes is out there and he asked me if I could make a better apple pie."

"No apple pie!" He nearly shouted.

"Of course not.  I wouldn't lower myself to common food."  I stuck my tongue out at my father.

"Fine, fine."  He said to me then shouted his next order down the line.

I wasn't a baker by any means.  But I could make apple compot and put it filio dough and bake for a little while.  It would be light and crispy and taste almost like apple pie and it fit the rustic feel.

I served it up on a plate and showed Babbo.  He gave me a nod and called out the order and it went out to Zane and his friend.  I sent him a text and hoped he didn't make a big deal of it.

I was mad.  But I wasn't trying to be a dick.  I was hurt but whatever.  I could deal.  I was nothing more than eye candy.  I knew he liked looking at me.  I loved looking at him.  I guess that's all it was.  And I could deal with that.  AT least that was what I kept telling myself.

I finished up in the kitchen with my father.  By closing time at 10pm I was drained.  I'd had a quick texting conversation with Zane and I wasn't sure how I felt about it.  He was with a girl... I wondered what he was doing with her.  As I washed the last of the pots and pans and wiped down the cooking areas one last time my mind wandered.

Babbo stopped next to me and frowned, "You've washed this spot for ten minutes.  Where's your head boy?"

"Where it shouldn't be."

He pushed a plate at me.  "Did you try it?" He asked.

I shook my head.

"Try it."

I took a small bite of it and tasted my handy work.  I shrugged.

"That was beter than I expected for something so simple." He said.  "Would you like to take a head chef shift every week while school is on break?"

My eyes went wide, "You're going to let me cook when you aren't feeling bad?"

"You've proven yourself time and time again.  It's about time I see what you can do."

"You are going to be here?"

"Yes.  I'l be your sous chef."

"You hate being my sous chef."  I laughed.

"I will do it for the month you are out."  He held out his hand, "Do we have a deal?"

I nodded.  "Yes sir."  I took his hand.  "What night?"

"Let's make it easy.  Start on Tuesday and we'll work through each day as the weeks go by.  Will that work for you?"

I opened up my phone and nodded and adjusted my schedule.  "I work anyway so yeah.  Just need to tweak the notes."

He patted my back.  "Let's get home.  Take your father the last piece of this apple tart and see what he thinks of your handy work."

I smiled at him and we left the kitchen in darkness to wait for the next afternoon's rush.  At least somethings were working out alright.
