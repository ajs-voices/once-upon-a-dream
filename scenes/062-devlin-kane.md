# Devlin Kane

**Angel**

I was still reeling from the information Zane had added.  I hadn't expected Zane to want to help more than give me advice, but this was this thing.  He had an MBA and a marketing degree I'd take all the help I could get.  But I didn't want to get his hopes up either.

Mr. Kennedy's departure left a long hanging silence in the kitchen.  I was pretty sure Zane was waiting on me to make the next move.  I set the papers down on the counter and smiled.  I didn't say anything until I had my arms wrapped around his neck and we were face to face only inches apart.  "Thank you," was all I managed to get out before I was pressing my lips against his and his hands pulled my hips against his.

Lunch would have been forfeit if there wasn't a knock at the door when Zane's hands were unbuttoning my jeans.  We both groaned at the interruption and kissed a little longer before Zane parted and sighed.  "I'll get it.  Finn has a key."

Of that I knew, he'd come in unannouced before - thankfully nothing riske was happening.  Not that Zane or I were particularly shy about things, but Finn didn't more to lord over us.  He was already picking up too many things.

It was just the three of us for lunch while Drew was taking care of his family.  Finn said he'd take them the left overs for which we were grateful, saved us the trip.

The end of my last class was drawing near.  The next six weeks would be an externship.  I could have easily picked up the hours at Fiore, but I'd worked Fiore my whole life.  I knew everything but the business side of things.  That's what Hector was for.  Cino was Babbo's provisioner and he was in charge of the kitchen and very little else.  Hector did everything else.  It sounded very much like Zane, Drew and Finn.  The whole business plan was left for now, mostly because Zane and I hadn't realy had time to sit down and talk about it.  But today I had time, and I had a question or two to ask Zane that had little to do with the business plan, but I was home early and I hoped he'd still be in.

When I opened the front door the lights were all on and it looked promising.  I called out, "Zane, you home?"

But nothing answered me.  In the living room there was a guitar laid out on the coffee table.  It wasn't one of Zane's.  I headed for the studio but it was unlike Zane to leave his guitar's lying around.  I heard an unfamiliar voice in Zane's studio and when I stood in the doorway Zane and the other man had a pair of thick headsets on and that was why no one heard me.  Short of tapping them on the shoulder I didnt' know how to get their attention so I went into the kitchen and started to make some coffee.  I knew the smell would bring Zane at the very least curious why he was smelling coffee.  It was the middle of the day I wasn't supposed to be here, but I was hungry so I pulled out the chicken salad, swiss cheese, dill mustard and the rye bread to make a simple panini.  Or as Zane liked to call it a squished sandwish.

I was pouring a cup of coffee when I heard them talking in the hall.  Zane came out first and was scrubbing his hand through his hair.  I grinned at him as poured cream and added the 2 sugars he liked in his coffee. He saw the frech press behind me and he almost did his Homer impression.  "I didn't want to bother you.  I didn't think you'd appreciate it."

Zane too the cup from my hands and pressed a kiss to my lips.  I looked past him and smiled, "Can I get you some coffee? or a sandwich?"   As I waited for my answer I got the chance to look at Zane's friend.  His brown hair fell to his shoulders, his face was ... and his lips... I knew him, but I didn't know him.  I looked back at Zane with a grin, "You sold songs to the House of Crowley?"

Zane smirked, "Took you long enough."  Zane turned to Devlin and smiled.  "Devlin this is Angel.  Angel, you know Devlin Kane."

"Yeah, " I nodded, "Question still stands, Mr. Kane, do you want coffee and/or a sandwich."

His smile lit his face and I had no doubt in my mind that every girl in the room woul have been weak kneed.  Fuck I almost was.  But I wasn't about to let it show.  It wasn't the first famous person I'd met.  That was the thing about working with my Dad at one of the best five star restaurants in the City.  People from all walks of life came in to eat.  I'd met a few actors and actresses and a few band members over the years, but this was the first time one was in my house - or Zane's house.

Devlin laughed, "I'll take coffee, cream and sugar."  He looked down at the sandwich I was making.  "For a chef in the making this is a rather benign lunch."

As I made him a coffee I laughed.  "Not really.  Taste it."

Zane nodded at Devlin.  "Are you making enough for everyone?"  He asked.

"That was the plan lover."  I said pressing a kiss to his temple as I walked past to give Devlin Kane a coffee.

The same look I had when I first saw Devlin passed across his face after the first bite.  Zane wrapped his arm around me and asked, "Where's mine?"

"I'll get you one, go sit down."  I shoved him playfully but Zane didn't move, he rarely did, instead pulling me tighter against me with a look on his face that made me weak and he felt the weight shift.  Zane let me go after I caught myself and chuckled to himself.  I could guarantee that Zane was congradulating himself on making me weak visibly.  Devlin was too busy eating to have noticed, but Zane was still puffing out his chest a little more than normal.

I tried to ignore the fact that my boyfriend was sitting next to Devlin Kane in our kitchen.  I had so many questions but I wasn't going to ask them.  I instead busied myself with making Zane a sandwich and myself one.  Devlin asked, "Can I have another?"

I nodded, "Sure."  I had enough food and if I had to eat something else or god forbid make more I wasn't going to be heart broken.

Devlin looked at Zane and nodded in my direction, "He's not very talkative.  I expected a barrage of questions and fawning."

Zane chuckled.  "He works the service industry, he's used to the rich and famous."

"But this isn't some restaurant."

I laughed.  "Isn't it?  I seem to always be feeding people from it.  I am not getting paid per meal like a restaurant, but you can never tell who will show up for food."

Zane nodded.  "My friends pop in all the time for food.  I think Finn is the worst."

I shook my head, "No Mandy is."

"She's just coming by to see the pretty boy in my kitchen, not so much to eat."

"It a lot of both." I said.

Devlin finished the second sandwich just as I started eating my own.  "You should come by Zion this Saturday night.  House of Crowley will be playing."

"What time?" I asked.  I'd seen them play before but the fact that I now knew Zane wrote a few of their songs I was more than intriqued to listen again, but I had to work.

"All night."

I nodded.  "I'll try to make it.  I have to work."

Zane smiled, "We don't have to do brunch on Sunday.  I'll cancel for both of us."

I grinned at him.  "Alright."

Devlin stood up.  "Angel.  That was excellent.  It was nice meeting you, but I have to get back to the band.  We've a few new sets to rehearse before Saturday."

New Sets?  Had Zane just sold a few more songs?  I went about cleaning up the mess in the kitchen while Zane said good bye to his friend.

The front door opened and closed and soon Zane was in the kitchen, "Why you home so early?"

I smiled at him.  "I needed to talk to you."

"That doesn't sound foreboding at all." Zane joked but I could hear the worry in his voice.

"It's not **that** kinda talk.  Me and you we are good.  It has to do with the last 6 weeks of classes.  I told you about the externship."

Zane nodded.  "Yeah neither you or your dad want you to work Fiore."

I nodded.  "Babbo's been in touch with a friend, said he'd take me.  It's a high pressure place, lots of new experiences."

"Sounds great."  Zane smiled.

"It's in Las Vegas, so not so great.  He works at one of the casios and owns like four of the restaurants and has offered to scuttle me about the four of them.  All different cuisine and it's Vegas.  It's six weeks, and ..." I sighed, and closed my eyes, "I want you to come with me."
