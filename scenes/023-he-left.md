# He Left

**Zane**

I woke up when the light when off and the bed was empty.  Fucking bastard.  I was half tempted to get out of bed but when I uncovered the air was too cool for me and I curled back up in bed and sulked.  I tried to go back to sleep, but I was too pissed.  The bathroom door opened and he walked out, I caught a glimpse of his still naked body as he flipped the light off.  My heart leapt and I breathed a sigh of relief.  He stumbled against the bed and when we spoke he didn't sound like he was alright as he crawled back into bed.

We kissed and I held him.  He seemed to calm down and fall asleep.  I wondered what the fuck had happened and why I had to find a guy who was not exactly stable.  He was showing me all sorts of oddities.  But it only made me want to get to know him more.  He was everything my parents didn't want.  And it made me smile that was the case.  My parents wanted the best for me.  I knew it.  I knew they wanted me to be happy too, but they wanted a daughter-in-law and grandkids.  I couldn't give them that with Angel.  I couldn't beleive I was even thinking about that in the same thought.  I just met him.  I mean I'd seen him around, but we'd spoke all of a handful of times.

Though the sex... I fell asleep to the thought of his body on top of me.  His lips pressed to mine.  The small noises he made as we had sex.  I wanted more...

****

Something woke me again.  The sun was streaming in through the windows and the bed was empty again.  I curled back up under the blankets and pulled the pillow Angel had slept on over my face.  Fuck!  The pillow smelled like him.  I tossed it across the room.  The floor had been picked up and two tuxes laid on the chair in the corner.  Two!

He hadn't left.  Then where was he?

I sat up and listened. I smelled bacon and coffee and smiled.  He was cooking for me.  I heard him swear and crawled out of bed.  I padded to the drawers and pulled on a pair of boxers and sweats and grabbed a t-shirt to pull on as I walked into the kitchen.  I stood off to the side and took in the sight.  Pretty boy was wearing a plain white t-shirt and his boxers.  He had to be cold.  He was dancing around **my** kitchen with a pair of earbuds in.  He didn't notice me standing there as he stirred a bowl and then moved across the way to check on something in the oven.  I smelled coffee and wanted a cup.

I stepped into the area and he looked up and stopped with a surprised look on his face.  I gave him a smirk and stepped closer he was in front of the cupboard with the coffee cups.  He had a rather large mark on his neck and I ran my fingers over it and he ducked his head.  I liked seeing the shy side of him.  It came out so rarely.  I tucked my fingers under his chin and pressed a kiss to his lips and he sighed.  "I need coffee."

Angel put his hand on my chest and pushed me backwards.  "Sit.  Let me do this."

I did as he instructed and went to the other side of the island and sat down.  He pulled out the earbuds and let them hand around his neck.  I could hear the faint music that had been soundless before.  I didn't know what it was.  He pulled two mugs from the cupboard he'd been standing in front of and set them on the counter.  On the stove top was a weird canister but when he poured the hot brown liquid from it I was surprised. I didn't own a french press.  "Where did you get all this stuff?"  As a matter of fact my fridge was pretty empty.

He smiled at me as he add milk and a little sugar to the coffee.  But he didn't finish with just that.  From the oven he pulled out a pastry.  It looked like what he'd made for dessert the other night except it was more purple in color than apple colored.

He set a plate in front of me with a latte?  He finally spoke once he placed a fork next to the plate.  "A traditional Italian breakfast.  I have finished what you'd expect yet."

"Where did you get all this?"

He grinned.  "I called Cino at Fiore while he was stocking and preping for today and had him pick me up extras and some equipment too."

He turned back to his cooking.  I saw the bacon under the silver lid and he started crumbling the bacon with his fingers and it went straight to my cock.  I wanted to lick his fingers clean of the bacony goodness.  Fuck!  What was wrong with me?  I wasn't a fucking teenager anymore.

He licked his own fingers before washing them in the sink then drying them off.  I don't think he understood what he had done just to me with both of those actions.  I had to adjust myself on the bar stool.

He added cheese and some herbs and what looked like red peppers into the bowl and gave it all a good mix before he added oil to the hot pan and spread it all around.  He dumped the mixture into the pan and let it set.

He picked up the dish with the bacon in it and set it next to me with a grin.  "I hope you like bacon."

I laughed, "You you have no fucking idea."

He grinned and picked up a peice and brought it to his lips before he picked up another and held it out for me.  I took the piece of crunch goodness making sure I brushed his fingers as I did it.  His eyes closed briefly as I touched him and he licked his fingers again and moved back towards the eggs in a pan.

I finished the bacon in my hand before I said anything, "You need to stop doing that."

Angel looked up at me with questioning eyes.  "Doing what?"  He sounded all innocent I almost beleived him.

"Licking your fingers like that."

He grinned.  "Sorry."  And he went to the sink and washed his hands again.

More cheese was added to the top of the eggs before he slide them into the oven.  I don't think my kitchen ever smelled this good.  He sipped at his coffee then set it down.

Angel found the plates and the silverware without searching through the cabinets and drawers.  I wondered when he looked through my kitchen.  It made me nervous what he thought of it.  I didn't cook but I had things to cook with yet he seemed to bring all his own things.  Did he do this for other people?  Was this his game?

We sat in silence.  I watched my guest cooking for me in a t-shirt and boxers.  He was leaning against the counter near the stove chewing on his bottom lip, his head hung and staring at the ground.  His lips were moving but he wasn't making any sound.  "What's going on in your head?"

He looked up with a smile but held up a finger.  I was confused.  His lips were still moving and when they stopped he turned to the oven and pulled out the pan and set it on top of a hot plate.  "Sorry.  I was keeping time."

"You were counting?"  I asked curious.

"No, singing a song in my head since I didn't have my headset on."

"You keep time with a song?"

He grinned at me.  "It's something my dad taught me when I had trouble reading a clock.  He says if you use a timer you aren't paying enough attention to your work."

"How does that work in a restaurant when you are doing multiple things at the same time."

He shrugged. "It's a talent you pick up.  The only timers allowed in Fiore's is when you are slow roasting the vegetables and meat and that is usually started by Cino as part of prep."

Angel plated the egg pancake and drizzled it with a sauce that had been sitting on the counter.  He added a peice of toast and set two plates on the bar, one next to me I assumed was his.  He brought the coffee fixings with him and sat down next to me.  "A fritatta with bacon, spinach, basil and sun roasted tomatoes with a light pesto sauce and filo dough cheese bread."

The plate looked like something I'd get at Fiore's.  Plated just right, it looked too good to eat, but when I glanced at Angel he was already eating.  I took a bite.  The egg was light and fluffy and filled with flavor mostly bacon but I tasted everything else too.  I had more questions, but right now my mind was full on just eating.  When I was halfway done, I looked over at him and smiled.  "If you cook this good, why aren't you married off already."  I joked and he took it as such.

He grinned at me, "I guess I'd have to actually date to find a good woman."

"Your family trying to find you a good one?" I asked out of curiousity.

He shook his head.  "No.  Dad would prefer I settled down with a woman.  But Babbo knows better than to push it."

"Is that how you distinquish between fathers?  It might get confusing."

"It really is all relative.  Dad is the lawyer, and Babbo is the chef.  Babbo says your father when referring to Dad and Dad says your dad when talking about Babbo.  It's confusing to normal people.  But half the time I'll just speak in their native tongue so they know who I'm talking to."

"Their native tongue?"  What the fuck.

"My parents emigated here.  Dad was born in Madrid Spain and came to the US to become a laywer.  Babboo was born in Caldare, a small town in Italy, he came to New York to attend school here.  They both learned English but when I was growing up they couldn't decide what to teach me so I learned all three at the same time.  It was difficult at first for me to understand that this word went with that word and not other words.  They both picked up the other language over the years, but there will talk in Italian or Spanish and I'll answer in English usually."

Angel finished his plate between stories and looked at me with a smile.  "You want more?"

"Fuck yes."  I said.  He got up and brought the left overs to the island and put it down so I could help myself then returned to his seat and picked at a peice of bacon.

"Your dad is a lawyer, your mom is a doctor.  You have any siblings?"  He asked.

I shook my head as I stuffed another forkful of his food into my mouth.  It wasn't very sexy but he was grinning while he watched me.  He nodded, "I don't either.  I was lucky they finally got the okay to adopt me."

"Why was there a problem?" I asked between forkfuls.

"Long depressing story, but most of it had to do with they were men who were having sex together."

He didn't want to talk about it.  I guess I wouldn't want to either if it was a long sad story.  He seemed happy now.  So I changed the subject to something I wanted to know.  "You do this often?"

Angel stood up and took his plate and empty coffee cup to the sink and started the hot water and squeezed in dish soap.  "I have a dishwasher."

He grinned and nodded.  "Yeah, and my dad would kill me if I used one when I have two good hands."  He turned around leaning against the sink.  "Do I do what often?" he asked in return.

"Use food to impress someone?"

Angel shook his head.  "I'd say no, but I cook all the time to impress people.  I don't think that's what you want to know though."

"What do I want to know then?"  I quipped.  I finished the last bite on my plate and looked at the remaining slice of fratta and wondered what he planned on doing with it.

"I have never cooked someone breakfast - other than family and friends.  I've never cooked anyone any meal with the express purpose of trying to get in their pants."  Angel grinned at me then turned back around to wash the dishes he had.  I stood up and took my empty plate and things to the sink and slid them into the hot soapy water and pressed my body against his backside wrapping my arms around him just above the sink.

I said, "But you already got in my pants."

He laughed.  I felt the muscles in his stomach contract and expand.  I pressed my lips against his neck and he let a small moan escape.  I knew he was bitting his bottom lip.  "I would have cooked for you either way."  He confessed.

I unfurled from him and gave him a playful shove.  "You mean I didn't have to sleep with you to get this awesome breakfast."  I leaned against the other sink he was using to put the clean dishes in and tried very hard not to smile.  But his eyes were a light with humor and his smile was bright.

Angel looked at me and leaned across and kissed me.  It was soft and tender and only a little tongue.  He hummed against my lips and that sent more blood rushing south.  "How the fuck do you do this to me?"

He laughed and stood back up to finish his cleaning.  "I could ask you the same thing."
