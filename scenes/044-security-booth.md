# Security Booth

**Angel**

Zane played the guitar.  There was a lot I didn't know about that blue eyed babe.  And I was in the mood to find out.  But I knew the night wasn't going to get any slower and Zane baby was his club.  Even I knew that.  He wouldn't leave her or his partners to drown on a day like today.  Even for me.  And that's the way it should be.

I would have left to go home if I hadn't said I'd spend the night with Zane.    I hadn't even planned to spend it with him after Christmas eve.  But I was glad I was here, with him.  I was even glad to be thrust into a steel box with his best friend and business partner.  I knew Finn.  He'd bumped me a few times when I was hot and heavy with a girl and got caught in the act.  He never threw me out.  But then I tipped well, even after stopping what I was doing.  It wasn't a bribe.  A thank you more or less and they knew it.  I'd still tip them if they threw me out.

I sat in the main office away from the monitors after Zane left.  Finn pushed his chair into the doorway and smiled.  "We don't bite."

I nodded.  "I know.  I'm a wiped out.  Been a rough day."

"Tell me about it."  Finn laughed.  "Really, tell me about it. Whatever fight you and Zane had.  I hope it had you as wound up as it did him."

He leaned back in his chair and watched the monitors in the other room.  If I hadn't known better I'd have said Finn was trying to tempt me into making a move.  His t-shirt was a size too small, it bulged in all the right places.  He was mouth-watering if you liked them big and beefy.  And on a normal day I might have been tempted but I had perfect thoughts coursing through my mind.  Zane wasn't as big as Finn.  He was taller, but not wider.  Finn was my normal type.  I was fond of Zane not being that type.

I shrugged.  "It wasn't pretty."

Finn sighed.  "You are about as talkative as he is about it."

"What did he tell you?"

Finn stood up and waved me into the other room.  "Hey Greg and Rick why don't you help out on the floor.  I got an extra set of eyes for now.  Mingle have a drink and enjoy working the room."  Finn laughed, "And I mean **a** drink."  Finn waitd for them to leave and sat down in one of the other chairs leaving the one he'd been sitting in for me.  "Watch the monitors with me."

I sat down and looked at all the screens and was thankful I didn't do this for a living.  There was no way I could keep an eye on everything.  Still reeling with information Finn cleared his throat.  "Zane doesn't talk much.  He's bent up about you though.  Your fight was over your kinks."

I shook my head.  "Not so much over my kinks.  Over a particular kink - the part where I'm submissive."

"He wasn't specific."  Finn said with a small chuckle.  "But I can't beleive **you** are a sub."

"Why don't you beleive it?  Cause I'm all up in your face look at me?"  I grinned.

Finn nodded.  "Pretty much."

"It's ruse.  Hides the truth.  But I'm not **a** sub.  I don't have a dom.  I'm not looking for one.  It's a way to destress to forget about the pressures of life.  Let someone else make all the decisions for a while."

Finn shook his head.  "It's not Zane."

"I know."  I sighed.  "Why does every one thing I don't know?"

"You'd give that up for a quick fuck?  You think you can give up girls and other guys and submission for one man?"  Finn shook his head.

"Zane isn't a quick fuck, Finn."  I said quickly.  It was out of my mouth before I could think.  It was the truth but it was difficult admitting I didn't want just sex with Zane.  I wanted - truly wanted - all those things I said.  "I'll tell you what I told him earlier.  I want the kinda guy Zane is and I want him to want me back."

"Oh he wants you alright."  Finn agreed.  "You've been tying him up in knots since he gave you his card."

I smiled.  "The feeling is mutual."  I sighed.  "I'm not giving anything up with Zane.  He has everything I want and need."

Finn laughed.  "He doesn't have a pussy."

"I hate to break it to you, Finn.  But I like cock better."  His jaw fell and I smirked at him and pointed at one of the screens.  "You watch me on here don't you?"

Finn cleared his throat.  "Yeah.  We have.  You can see why I made my comment."

"I know why you made it."  I looked at the big man with a grin.  "It's easier to get a quick fuck with a girl than with a guy.  The right girl, a skirt, unbuttoned jeans and a condomn are we are good to go.  A guy you need a little more privacy, you can't fuck right on the dance floor.  And while hands are nice and all...  But I'll spare you the details."

"I appreciate that.  How many girls have you taken out of here?  Or on the dance floor?  I've never seen you with the same one.  How do you keep it all straight?"

I shrugged.  "I don't do names.  I don't take numbers.  I have sex and I go home.  There is no relationships.  Nothing to worry about."

"How many times has a girl gotten angry at you?"

"Probably the same number I've walked out on."

Finn sighed. "You do that to Zane and not only will I ban you from ever entering Zion again I'll kick the shit out of you."

I smirked at Finn.  "You really think I'm afraid of you?  You can try to kick the shit out of me.  But I have no intentions of hurting Zane, or walking out on him.  I've already had that chance.  I stayed.  I made him breakfast."  I grinned at the memory of what followed breakfast, but that was between me and Zane.

We let the conversation slide away from me and Zane and focused on the screens, thankfully there was a nice scene forming in front of the bar.
