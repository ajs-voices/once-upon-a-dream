# You Should Go

**Zane**

When my phone rang I jumped.  I hadn't been expecting a call from Devlin anytime soon.  His ring tone was an easy one to recognize, one of the songs I'd sold him - the first double platnium hit for House of Crowley.  They had modified the tempo to an upbeat pop song, but it was all my work.  He was in town and wanted to see what I was working on.

Devlin always brought his guitar with him.  I made sure mine was handy before he showed up. Our impromptu jam sessions always made enemies of the neighbors but they didn't get it often.  The studio was sound proofed for that reason.  We sat on the couch playing old favorites, a few AC/DC hits, some of our own highschool music.

It was good catching up.  Devlin and I hadn't exactly fallen out of touch, just our worlds revolved around different things.  My music wasn't a money maker, it was fun and enjoyable, but I wasn't looking to make it big, though through Devlin I did - at least with a few songs.

We adjourned to the studio to listen to the peices I'd done, and the one I was working on.  He wanted them all, but wanted me to tweak a few of them.  They didn't quite fit House of Crowley.  And Devlin paid well, so I tried to listen to his direction, but I'm stubborn.  But he took most of the music with him and promised to play a set at Zion.  Which was also why he was in town - well his airplane needed maintenance and he had four weeks in town of which he wanted to play Zion with the band for a little extra cash and some publicity.  It was honestly the publicity he wanted, and I wasn't going to turn down the big names for the price I could get House of Crowley.

They would play this Saturday, and the next three Fridays.  It was last minute and I'd have to do some shuffling and some feather smoothing but it was well worth it for Zion.

But the smell of coffee drew us from the confines of the studio.  I thought I was smelling things, but when I took my earphones off I heard Angel in the kitchen.  He was the only one ever in my kitchen.  I tapped Devlin on the shoulder and he took his earphones off as well, "We done here?"  He nodded.  "I got someone I want you to meet."

Angel was in awe.  Who wouldn't be?  Someone famous and someone as good looking as Devlin standing there.  There was a tinge of jealousy but when Angel went weak in the knees at my kiss I was more than happy to let my pretty boy look at the pretty rockstar.

Devlin gave him the same look, or rather the sandwich.  Angel was tittering with joy, he seethed happy, but he kept his emotions in check and never once was a fanboi.  I knew his dad had a lot of say in how he reacted to famous people.

Devlin left me with parting words.  "I never pegged you to settle down, much less settle down with a man."

I smirked at my long time friend as I stood against the door frame.  "What he's not pretty enough?"

Devlin leaned around me to try and sneak another look at Angel in the kitchen.  He shrugged.  "I just didn't know I guess.  He cooks.  That's a lot more than some girls do."  He offered me his hand and we embraced in shoulder pat before Devlin was off down the hall with his guitar, and new music in hand.

Angel and I were alone in the middle of the day.  That was a hard concept to understand.  He was never home.  But when he dropped the bomb that the externship was in Vegas I had to try hard not to act unsurprised.  Angel's dad and I had already had a conversation about it.  He wouldn't have even offered it to Angel if I hadn't said he could go.  Not that I was going to say no to that.  It wasn't even my place.  But Chef Marco knew Angel better than I did and he said it was best if we were on the same page before Angel found out.

What I hadn't expected was for Angel to ask me to come with him.  So the whole unsurprised thing wasn't very hard to pull of since I was shocked he thought of even asking me.  And what sucked is that I had things planned with Devlin for the next month.  Which meant two weeks into Angel's externship.  I couldn't go with him.

I sighed.  "Angel, I'd love to go with you."  Though what the fuck would I do for six weeks while he worked?  I never asked him that question though.  "But, Devlin and I just agreed that we had business to handle and it'll last four weeks minimum."

Angel nodded, "That's alright, I'll find someting here.  I don't want to go."

Which was a complete fucking lie if I ever heard one.  But this was the reason that Marco had asked me I was positive now.  "You can't stay here because of me.  It's six weeks Angel.  Six weeks of experiences you can't get anywhere else."

He sighed and down on the bar stool he kept in the kitchen.  "No.  It's alright."

Something else was wrong.  Maybe he didn't want to go afterall.  But he had sounded so excited when he told me.  "What's wrong, pretty boy?"  I stood in front of him between his legs and lifted his chin so he looked up at me.

"It's a 5 and a half hour flight, not to mention all the stress leading up to it.  It's the two or three weeks of adjusting to the new bed, the new space, the schedule, the workload."  He sounded so broken.

"How did you manage a year and a half in Europe?"

Angel's eyes fell, I still held his chin, but he wasn't looking at me and I realized why, "Because you had Ant."

"It's not like that though."

"He didn't get you through the rough parts?" I asked.  I knew he was trying to reassure me that what he and Ant had wasn't what we had.

He nodded, "He did, but..."

I pressed my lips to Angel's to quiet him.  He let out a muffled moan and I pulled away with a smile. "It's alright.  I get it.  He's your bestfriend.  Yes, I'm jealous, but that was before me.  You didn't ask Ant to go with you this time?"

He shook his head and blurted out, "God, no."

"Then, there is nothing to worry about."  I kissed his forehead.  "But you **will** go to Vegas without me." His eyes flicked up to meet mine.  Angel scanned my expression, the tone of my voice had held a bit of command in it.  I knew how to manipulate him.  I tried not to do it, but this, this was worth the effort.  He wasn't going to miss this oppurtunity because of his own bullshit or because of me.  He'll be fine.  I knew it.  "I'll come visit when my schedule calms down."  His eyes lit up and there was a small smile.  "But not until after you've completely adjusted."  His smile turned to a grin.  I knew he was up for the challenge.

He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me close against his body.  "Your dad already told me about Vegas." I said.

He looked up at me and shook his head.  "Of course he did."  Angel took a big sigh and stood up.  Pressing his body against mine.  He bit his bottom lip and I kissed him. He moaned into my mouth and I could feel his growing hardon.  "Bedroom, please." he said.

I didn't need to be asked twice.
