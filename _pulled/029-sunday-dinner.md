# Sunday Dinner

**Zane**

It had been a long time since I had met someone's parents.  I couldn't imagine living with two fathers having one was enough.  But having no mom.  But once I left I didn't have time to think about his family my phone rang as I left Hal at the door with a $20, "That's from Angel.  He says thanks."  I answered my phone.  "Yes, mother?"

Her voice was soft.  "Darling, are you going to make brunch with Gram?"

"Yes, mother, I'm on my way now."

"Bring Jennifer if you are still with her."

I rolled my eyes.  "I dropped her off last night.  She had a bit too much to drink."

I went back to my apartment and changed into jeans.  I had a few marks on my neck but nothing like Angel had.

Gram lived in an apartment on the upper east side. Gramp passed away a few years ago.  He had been a lawyer like my father.   It ran in the family.  I was the only son not to follow in their footsteps.  My uncle is a lawyer.  My cousin Zack is a lawyer.  Today's brunch I'd have to listen to all their cases.  But Gram she'd ask about Zion.  I did one thing right by my dad and that was get my MBA from Columbia - his alma matar.  He was proud of that at least.

I knocked on the door of my grandmother's apartment on the sunday before Christmas Eve knowing we'd be here again tomorrow evening for dinner.  A small boy answered.  "Hey Kyle.  You aren't supposed to be answering the door by yourself."

My cousin Sara was at the door seconds later.  "Hey Zane.  Kyle let Zane in."

I picked up Kyle and steppped into the apartment.  "How's the hospital life treating you?"

Sara laughed.  "Fabulous.  You had fun last night?"

"You have no idea.  But my parents wouldn't be happy."  I grinned.

"Why not?"  Sara asked as we found Gram in the kitchen.

"He isn't exactly the one they set me up with last night."

Gram looked up from her pot.  "Zane.  You're early.  Your mother and father aren't here yet."

"I know.  I got an early start."  I walked around and hugged my Gram.

He yanked my head to the side and looked at the hickey.  "Sara, dear, can you help Zane cover them up so his father doesn't make an issue of it."

I laughed.  "I'm good Gram."

"I heard you say 'he'.  You know your father."

"So don't tell him it was a he.  He thinks I was with Jennifer last night."  I smiled.  "I don't intend on telling my father what I was doing last night."

Sara asked, "Or who you were doing?"  She giggled.

I set Kyle down, "Go play.  Maybe Uncle Zack will play."

He looked up at me and sighed.  "Uncle Zack sucks at playing, Zane.  Can't you play with me."

"In a bit.  Let me talk with Gram and your mom."

The boy rushed out of the kitchen.  I stepped up next the pot Gram was stirring. "Anything I can help with?"

"Why an interest Zane?"  Sara asked.

I chuckled, "New found love of cooking, what can I say."

Sara sat down and watched me stiring Gram's pot of sauce.  "So who were doing last night?"

"I don't kiss and tell."  I grinned.

"Oh come on tell me who he is."

I shook my head.  "I'll keep that to myself.  Just know that he's mine."

Sara laughed.  "Have you sworn off sharing Zane?"

I rolled my eyes.  "Sara, let's not even go there."

There was a knock on the door and Kyle rushed to the door again.  "He shouldn't answer the door like that."

Sara sighed.  "I know his father lets him."

I followed my little cousin to the door.  My father was on the other side and I offered him my hand and he shook it.  My mother I hugged.
