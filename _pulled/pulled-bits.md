***removed from good boy***

I shoved my sweats and boxers down in a rush and stepped out of them.  I opened the drawer next to my bed and pulled out a foil pack then crawled up next to his head.  "Suck my cock pretty boy, get me good and hard so I can fuck you."

The small whimper from his mouth was the only sign he couldn't wait.  He moved an arm under him so he could suck my cock.  I'd forgive the action.  Really wasn't another way around it unless I knelt over him.  He didn't use his hands, I hadn't said that.  He was literal interpretation and I had to wonder if he was always this way.

I groaned as he sucked and licked and rolled my cock around his mouth.  He inched closer and took me deeper until I was hitting the back of his throat.  He could make me come now but I pulled out of his hot wet mouth.  "Fuck pretty boy, you are good at that."  He beamed at the praise and returned to his position with his arms above his head.

I slide the condomn on from the foil packet.   Angel watched me as I pulled his legs into my lap he only moved to help me.  I had to ask, "You like this?"

"All of it."  He breathed out.

I pressed inside of him and he groaned.  He was so tight and so hot and I almost lost it when he moaned my name.  "Fuck"

I leaned down and pressed my lips to his as I moved inside him.  He kissed me back.  I tasted coffee and bacon on his tongue.  He whimpered under me.  His hands stayed above his head but he was eager for me to move inside him pressing into my thrusts chasing my lips when I backed away.  It wasn't hard and fast like the night before.  Slow and tender.  He his cock was leaking between us.  It was angry and red and he groaned when I preseed my body against him to push deeper inside.

Sweet slow was pushing me too far and I released inside of him my body shaking and he whimpered against my ear as I pressed inside of him.  "Come pretty boy, it's okay."  I pressed my lips to his and whispered, "just done for now." I added before I was drinking down the moan that came from my pretty boy.  His body arched and presed into mine and I could feel the warmth pooling between us.  He shook and I held him close kissing his neck, biting and sucking and leaving another mark.  I laid on top of him and kissed him more.  I didn't want the moment to end.  He seemed content to lie underneath me.  I pulled his arms down and wrapped them around my body and chuckled, "You can move now."

His hands gripped my back and he pulled me against his body tighter.  "You okay?" I asked.

"Yeah."  Was all he said.  I slide off and cleaned up without moving too far from him.  "You sure?"

He rolled on to his side and looked at me with those big brown eyes of his.  "I'm good.  I'm better than good.  Don't worry."  He said as he moved closer and pressed a kiss to my lips.  It was tender but there as a level need in it.  "I'll tell you when I don't like something."  He whispered as he pulled away.  He laid his head on his elbow and we stared at each other for a while.  He sighed and rolled on to his back.  "I need to get ready for work and talk to Babbo about New Years.  I should go."

He sat up and looked back at me.  I nodded.  "All right.  Call me later?"

"I will."

I watched as he pulled on his boxers and t-shirt then his tux pants.  He gathered everything else up and walked over to me and pressed a kiss to my lips.  It was soft and tender but I grabbed the t-shirt and pulled him closer.  I didn't want to watch him walk out the door.  Fuck, I didn't want him to leave.  I might not ever see him again.  It was the first time I had been afraid of not seeing someone again in a very long time.
