# My Boy

**Alex**

This wasn't fucking happening.  This fucking guy.  I knew Nox was a little on the submissive side but this was a different ball game.  His friend wasn't really a friend if he did this.  Nox begged me to take him home and I was inclined to do as he asked.  I wanted to punch his friend in the face.  Nox pressed against me.  "Please don't."

I closed my eyes and nodded.  Please... his please seemed to do it every time.

I looked at his tall dark and handsome friend and rolled my eyes.  "Undo what you did."

The man smirked.  "Ha vinto."  He sighed.

Nox relaxed into me and pressed a kiss to my neck. "He's not worth it."

"You okay?  Can I help you close up?"

He nodded.  "You can help me close up."  Nox stood up and turned to his friend.  "You fucking ever do that again after I told you it isn't happening I will lay you out.  No.  Ant you do it again at all I'll lay you out.  No more benefits.  You can't respect my relationships I shouldn't have to deal with your on again off again shit.  You need to go so I can close up."

"You are going to do this?" He asked.  "Over a guy."

"Ant.  I need you to leave now.  I'll talk to you later."

"Fuck this."  He said and left.  Nox looked defeated but he locked the door that Ant left through.

I asked, "You okay?"

He turned to me with a sad smile.  "I'm better cause you are here.  I'm glad you came to see me."  He dropped his eyes to the floor.  "I'm sorry about that."

"He do that often?"

"No.  His girlfriend of two years broke up with him.  He needed to be vent a little steam I guess."

"On you?"

He shrugged.  "It's not the first time.  But it'll be the last time."

"Is he one of the men who fuck you because you are pretty?"

Nox held out his hand to me and I told it and he flipped the lights out.  "Yes.  I'm the only guy Ant has sex with."

We were out in the cold.  "I hate him.  I'll be honest.  I saw him all over you outside the coffee shop and then the next time I saw him he was all over a girl."

Nox pulled me close and smiled.  "He's just a friend but I'll keep him at a distance."

"Don't do that.  He's your friend.  But promise me you won't let him do that to you again."   I didn't like that.    "I didn't like seeing you like that."

"It's been while.  If I fall into old habits I'm sorry."  Shit!

"Nox, I..."

He stopped and pulled me into a doorway out of the wind.  "Alex.  I don't want guys like Ant.  I don't need a dominant or a top."

"What do you want and
