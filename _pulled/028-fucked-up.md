He laughed.  It was a good laugh, better than the shy smile.  "Because you know who I am."

"What do you mean?"  I asked playing dumb.  I knew exactly what he meant.

He stood up and started folding the tux which was bad.  I followed him and took it all away from him and dropped it on the bed.  I had an extra suit case he could borrow.  Hell hangers and garbage bag would work better than folding.  I went to busy the busy work while I waited for him to answer.

Angel watched me putting his tux on the hanger.  "You know what I mean.  I'm sure Derek at the door, or one of the security guys has told you stories."

Fuck!  We were going there.  "Assuming I've heard these stories, should I be worried? Am I just a meaningless fuck?"  I snapped and yanked the tux coat onto the hanger.  Fuck!

He walked up behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist and pressed his face into the space between my neck and shoulder.  I felt his eyes close, like butterfly wings on my skin.  His breathing had changed, I wasn't sure if it was faster or slower, or maybe he was trying to control it.  Angel's voice was quiet when he finally spoke.  "If you were a meaningless fuck.  I wouldn't be here, the next more.  I wouldn't have made breakfast.  I wouldn't have come home with you to begin with.  I don't go home with guys I pick up randomly."

"You just fuck them on the dance floor."  I said and pulled out of his embrace.

He took three steps back and his hands went for pockets that weren't there, then into his hair, he was getting upset.  I was upsetting him.  I was upsetting myself and for what reason?  Because he was playing me!

Despite the anxiety I saw in his posture and his face he spoke clearly.  "I don't fuck guys on the dance floor."  His back straightened and his chin met his chest.  His hands went behind his back and he stood tall.  "I don't trust the guys I pick up enough to go home with them.  Or fuck in a public place.  There needs to be established rules."

I looked at him confused and then it hit me.  All this doing what I said, his asking permission.  He was someone's sub.  Fuck!

"I'm not into that Angel."

Everything in him shrank.  He whispered.  "I know. And I haven't since before college.  But the guys I typically like are bigger and stronger than I am.  So there needs to be rules.  I don't pick up guys at normal clubs and bars.  I go for one reason and one reason alone."

"And what is that reason?"

I didn't think he could shirnk anymore or get any smaller but he did.  He would collapse in on himself if he could.  His voice was barely a whisper.  "I go for excessivly rough sex, so I can be treated like the peice of trash I feel like sometimes."

I breathed out, "Fuck me!"  I hadn't meant to say it but I had.  His entire demanor changed in the same of this conversation and I was just falling into the same patterns he liked.  I sank to the bed and sat down and just stared at the man who had confessed his dark secrets to me.

# Fucked Up

**Angel**

And the morning went down hill.  Of course it did.  It was how it always happened.  I don't know why it happened but it did.  This was the problem with dating.  This was why I didn't do it because the moment they found out about my past was the moment I became an asshole to them.  I wasn't worthy of their attention.

Zane was sitting on the bed just staring at me.  I couldn't read him, but then again I wasn't trying.  I didn't even want to look at him.  I told him my deepest darkest secret and he sat there staring at me.  Disgust and shame coursed through my body.  I hated that was what I was.  That I wanted someone to hurt me when I felt like shit.

I let out a slow breath of air and licked my lips.  I felt like I was going to fall down.  I needed to go home.  I needed to change and get to work.  "I should go."  I didn't wait for an acknowledgement I grabbed the hanger he'd prepared for me and he caught my hand.

"You are going to leave like that?"

"What would you have me do?  I can't change the past.  I hate myself everytime I find a guy to fuck me.  I thought this was different but ..."

"Did I hurt you?"  His voice was pained.

"No."  I bleated.  "You were perfect."  My other hand darted to his cheek, my thumb caressing his lips.  "I regret nothing."  I grinned down at him, "Except maybe the last few minutes.  You were perfect.  I want to see you again."

"But?"  Zane asked but his eyes never looked up to meet mine.

"I don't think you want to now.  I'm broken Zane.  I'm getting my shit together now.  But there is still alot fucked up."
